Adding an extra layer of anonymity, Costner donned a pair of sleek black sunglasses.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kanye West Is Selling Another House As Bianca Censori Takes Legal Control Of His Estate</a></span></p><p>While it might appear to be a leisurely jaunt, Costner's presence in Scotland is predominantly work-related. Observers spotted him en route to the Royal Scottish National Orchestra building situated within the exalted Royal Concert Hall. There, he convened with colleagues to deliberate over a film's score. Curiously, he opted against utilizing a chauffeur, personally traversing from his hotel to the filming location.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This Scottish sojourn could potentially offer respite for the actor, who finds himself entrenched in a complex domestic tangle back on American soil. His spouse of nearly twenty years, Christine Baumgartner, initiated divorce proceedings in June. However, she bucked against the requisites of their prenuptial agreement, choosing to stay put in their shared abode.</p><p>Initial reports suggested that Christine's financial constraints immobilized her relocation plans. A child support agreement for their three offspring took precedence before she'd contemplate an alternate dwelling.</p><p>As a temporary solution, she sought refuge in the staff quarters on their expansive property. Eventually, she secured new accommodations, a <a href=#>residence reputedly fetching $35,000 in monthly rent</a>, a financial obligation undertaken by Kevin himself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Kevin Costner's net worth hovers around a remarkable $100 million mark, the terms of their prenuptial agreement have gained traction for the relatively modest settlement earmarked for Christine. <a href=#>A mere $1 million is her stipulated entitlement.</a> The lion's share of their assets, including their familial domicile which Costner had procured long before their nuptials, remain staunchly under his ownership.</p><p>As the estranged couple navigates the treacherous waters of divorce, Costner found himself addressing an uncomfortable volley of interrogations in pursuit of an eventual settlement. To address Christine's plea for financial documentation, Costner's legal team filed a response wherein he staunchly denied any need to produce receipts pertaining to purported extramarital dalliances, as such incidents had not transpired from his end.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Respondent has no responsive documents for 'extramarital romantic relationships' in which he engaged because he engaged in none," <a href=#>court documents affirmed.</a></p><p>Notably, Costner's legal representation accused Christine of using the financial disclosure request as a veiled instrument of harassment, deeming it excessively broad in terms of chronology and subject matter. The filing additionally expressed that Costner remained uninformed about any potential affairs on Christine's part during their marital journey.</p><p>A thread of irony runs through the annals of Costner's matrimonial history. Having previously weathered an exorbitantly expensive divorce with Cindy Costner from 1978 to 1994, culminating in an $80 million settlement, he seemingly harbored a newfound resolve when crafting his second prenuptial agreement, presumably a direct result of his past experience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:<a href=#> Sam Asghari Will Make Nothing From Britney Spears Divorce If Prenup Holds</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8qeraKmXZi8tMDNnqlmnJWjtqa%2FjKynnqaUnruoecyopZ6xXaS7brTIrGSapJyatKawjKagrKyimsC0ecinZKedp2KxqsLOq5qeZZaeuaq6xmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
