So it’s best to just shut up.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Brittany-Matthews-Defends-Jackson-Mahomes-After-Drama.jpeg><p>The fan didn’t specify which comments were being referred to, but Jackson, 22, has found himself at <a href=#>the center of controversy</a> several times. Recently, the allegations became much more serious as he is under investigation for an alleged assault.</p><p>The<a href=#> Kansas City Star</a> reported in March that Jackson was accused of shoving a teen waiter and forcibly kissing restaurant owner <strong>Aspen Vaughn</strong> on February 25.</p><p>“He forcibly kissed me out of nowhere,” Vaughn told the Star, “and I’m telling him, pushing him off saying ‘what are you doing?’ and then he proceeded to do it two more times where the last time I was pushing him off and I can see on the cameras that somebody was outside the office door and I was yelling for them to come help because he’s big and massive.”</p><p>The <a href=#>TikTok star</a>‘s lawyer denied the allegations. “Jackson has done nothing wrong. Our investigation has revealed substantial evidence refuting the claims of Jackson’s accuser, including the statements of several witnesses,” his attorney <strong>Brandan Davies</strong> said. “We have reached out to law enforcement to provide the fruit of our investigation so that they may have a complete picture of the matter.”</p><p>Prior to the assault allegations, Jackson made headlines for pranks and immature behavior. The Texas native poured water on Ravens fans who were taunting him after a Kansas City Chiefs loss in September 2022. He responded via social media, writing, ”They were thirsty.”</p><p>Patrick’s brother is often seen dancing on the sidelines, but he landed in hot water in October 2021 when he made a TikTok while standing on the late Sean Taylor’s number.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I want to sincerely apologize for accidentally being on the Sean Taylor #21 at FedEx Field,” Jackson tweeted at the time. “We were directed to stand in that area and I meant absolutely no disrespect to him or his family.”</p><p>Though several Chiefs fans have taken to social media to call Jackson’s behavior “embarrassing,” the NFL pro <a href=#>shut down a report</a> in February 2022 that he no longer wanted Brittany or Jackson at his games because they are a “distraction” and “their sideline antics are bad for his brand.”</p><p>“Y’all just be making stuff up these days 😂😂😂,” he said at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabqpmpwaK62GakmqyknbK4v4ydnJ%2BdnpnAbrbAnKKsp55iuqK0zqacrGWRm8GmvoydqZqlkWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
