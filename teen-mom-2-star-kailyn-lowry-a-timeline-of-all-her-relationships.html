These famous moms have been navigating the trials and tribulations that come with parenthood...and anything else that life throws at them...for over a decade! The series had a spinoff, titled&nbsp;Teen Mom 2,&nbsp;in late 2010. This spinoff introduced a new group of young mothers, one of whom was Kailyn Lowry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since completing&nbsp;nine seasons on&nbsp;Teen Mom 2, Kailyn has given us a personal look into her life.

We were introduced to a pregnant, 16-year-old Kailyn. She was expecting a child with her high school sweetheart, Jo Rivera.
