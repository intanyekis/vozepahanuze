It appears that many viewers are also willing to go to great lengths to view these commercials beyond their original air date during the big game. During the 2019 Super Bowl, consumers spent a total of 641 thousand hours watching Super Bowl ads on YouTube, which represents a 58 percent increase from the previous year.</p><h2 id=how-much-do-celebrities-like-miles-teller-get-paid-for-super-bowl-commercials>How Much Do Celebrities Like Miles Teller Get Paid For Super Bowl Commercials?</h2><p>Commercials during the Super Bowl have become a lucrative source of income for celebrities, with advertisers paying around $4.5 million for a 30-second spot.

Ad spots for the first Super Bowl in 1967 cost a mere $37,500 (about $338,000 in today's dollars), but the average price had reached $1 million by the mid-1990s.

In June of last year, Anheuser-Busch, the parent company of Bud Light, announced the end of its exclusivity deal that was first established in 1989.</p><p>Nonetheless, the company remains a significant presence at NFL games, sponsoring all major off-season NFL moments, including the 2022 NFL Draft in Las Vegas. Despite no longer holding exclusive rights, Anheuser-Busch remains the largest beverage advertiser during the Super Bowl, with three minutes of national airtime and a 30-second regional Budweiser spot.</p><h2 id=what-was-the-song-from-the-miles-teller-bud-light-super-bowl-ad>What Was The Song From The Miles Teller Bud Light Super Bowl Ad?</h2><p>One element of the Bud Light Super Bowl commercial that has garnered attention is the hold music featured in the ad. Many viewers have expressed their interest in knowing the name of the song, as it is often associated with the experience of being put on hold during a phone call.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The music has been praised for making the typically frustrating experience of waiting on hold more tolerable or even enjoyable.

It has gained notoriety due to its presence as a default hold music on Cisco phone systems. The composition was created in 1989 by the then-16-year-old composers using a four-track recorder. They were both Yanni enthusiasts and shared a passion for music production.</p><p>Carleton offered the song to the design team when he began working for Cisco Systems in the 1990s, and it was incorporated into the final product for the company's phone systems. Despite its widespread use, Carleton neglected to copyright the tune or establish a licensing agreement, so he has not received any royalties for its usage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Musicians Who We Think Should Play The Super Bowl Halftime Show">Musicians Who We Think Should Play The Super Bowl Halftime Show</a></span></p><p>The Super Bowl has become more than just a major sporting event in the United States.
