Joe got six comedians that never been funny he wanna push out. But that’s really how it is.” This soundbite was among the many clips from the interview that went viral on social media.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Rogan jumped on X, <a href=#>formerly known as Twitter</a>, to address these comments. “I love Katt,” he wrote on Thursday (Jan. 4). “He’s one of my favorite comics and I’d love to have him on. We talk about him all the time. If he’s down I’ll make it happen.” Check out the clip and Rogan’s tweet below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I love Katt.

Williams doubled down on the allegation that the Barbershop actor <a href=#>stole his joke</a>, which Cedric addressed in <a rel=nofollow href=#>his appearance</a> on Club Shay Shay in November 2022.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“He thought that I was just a no-name comedian, and that he could take this joke and nobody would know,” he said. “The issue was that I had already done this particular joke on BET’s&nbsp;ComicView&nbsp;twice. It had done so well… that they made it part of the commercial. This is not just a random joke, this is my best joke…it’s my closing joke.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He claimed that Cedric The Entertainer attended the comedy show where he first said the joke and even fellowshipped with him afterward. Two years later, he was using the same joke on The Original Kings Of Comedy. Cedric has since responded to Williams, stating that his <a href=#>“tough talk” is “corny”</a> after the latter said he would’ve punched him in the stomach.
