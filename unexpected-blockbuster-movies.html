We can anticipate the popularity of the next <a href=#>Marvel</a> movie or pretty much anything <a href=#>Steven Spielberg</a> is working on, right? That was not always the case.</p><p>Spielberg’s 1975 summer hit, <a href=#>Jaws</a>, cemented the term for a <a href=#>movie</a> not expected to make much revenue but becomes a household name – the summer blockbuster.</p><p>In a 1998 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TIME</a> piece by film critic Roger Ebert, he wrote, “Spielberg changed the course of modern Hollywood history. Jaws was a hit of vast proportions, inspiring executives to go for the home run instead of the base hit.”</p><p>Today, directors are crossing their fingers to make the next great American Blockbuster and several of those films have come out of the dark, surprising both movie-goers and the industry alike.</p><p>If you haven’t seen one of the films on this list, you may want to check it out.</p><h2 id=blair-witch-project-248-million>Blair Witch Project: $248 Million</h2><p>The budget was $60,000 and included unknown actors and actresses. The draw for the film was due to fans believing the film content was real; three film students go into the wood to make a documentary and the shaky “footage” and up-close frames led the audience to believe in the fear of the young people.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The film opened to $1.5 million and eventually climbed the charts to $140 million domestic and $248 million worldwide. Dollar-for dollar, the film is one of the most profitable movies of all time.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Netflix Will Release A New Film Every Week In 2021</a></span></p><h2 id=star-wars-307-million>Star Wars: $307 Million</h2><p>It seems silly to movie-goers today that Star Wars would be anything but a blockbuster hit but when the first film in 1977 hit theaters, director George Lucas didn’t even go to the premiere because he thought it wouldn’t be that big of a deal. At the start of Lucas’ career, he was handed $11 million to make the sci-fi film about space and solving disputes via light saber action sequences. During the first weekend, the movie earned $1.5 million to everyone’s surprise and the popularity soared.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In its initial 18-month run, Star Wars made $307 million, and the rest is history. As of today, the first film in the mega-hit franchise is the second highest-grossing movie of all time, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Looper</a>.</p><h2 id=my-big-fat-greek-wedding-368-million>My Big Fat Greek Wedding: $368 Million</h2><p>Tom Hanks and wife Rita Wilson believed in the comedic one-woman show performed by Nia Vardalos about her life in a big Greek family. Offering $5 million to make the film and insisting Vardalos stars, Hanks and Wilson had no idea the film would gross $241 million domestic and $368 million worldwide, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Screen Rant</a>. The movie never made it to the #1 spot at the box office (the second highest grossing film to do so) but it is the highest grossing romantic comedy ever.</p><h2 id=slumdog-millionaire-378-million>Slumdog Millionaire: $378 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With a cast of unknown Indian actors and a budget of $15 million, director Danny Boyle didn’t expect a blockbuster on his hands. The film opened strong with $360,000 and eventually expanded to $375 million worldwide.</p><h2 id=pretty-woman-432-million>Pretty Woman: $432 Million</h2><p>A relative newcomer to Hollywood, Julia Roberts and well-known actor with no big hits in nearly a decade, Richard Gere, teamed up to make a film about a wealthy tycoon meeting a hooker. Doesn’t seem like a blockbuster in the making but given a $14 million budget and opening weekend raking in $11 million, Pretty Woman climbed the charts to an impressive $432 million during it’s time at the box office.</p><h2 id=jaws-470-million>Jaws: $470 Million</h2><p>You can’t make a list of blockbuster hits without including the original. Spielberg was given a $3.5 million budget which became $12 million as issues arose throughout filming. If the movie didn’t bring in revenue, Spielberg’s massive budget overruns would create a name for himself that he didn’t want. As luck would have it, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shortlist</a> says&nbsp;Jaws opened to $7 million and eventually reached $470 million worldwide, launching Spielberg’s career and the summer movie blockbuster season we all know and love.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=home-alone-476-million>Home Alone: $476 Million</h2><p>John Hughes wrote the screenplay with Macaulay Culkin in mind but passed the directorial job on to newcomer Chris Columbus. 20th Century Fox hoped for a modest holiday revenue from the film, but the $18 million budget was made back during opening weekend and revenue soared to $476 million worldwide, making the little holiday film one of the biggest hits of all time.</p><h2 id=the-sixth-sense-672-million>The Sixth Sense: $672 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Night Shyamalan’s first major hit was a surprise, perhaps even to him. Shyamalan wrote the script and while it was popular among studios and A-list actor Bruce Willis signed on, no one expected the $293 domestic and $672 million worldwide for a young boy who sees dead people. In 1999, the film was second to Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, beating out Toy Story 2 and Austin Powers 2.</p><h2 id=rocky-1-5-billion>Rocky: $1.5 Billion</h2><p>Actor Sylvester Stallone’s career was pretty much at a standstill. Nearly 30 years old and having only stared in a handful of low budget films, he wrote a screenplay in a matter of three days, titled Rocky, about a boxer in Philadelphia and his rise to success.</p><p>Producers wanted to use the film for current, popular actors at the time, but Stallone insisted he play the lead role for rights to the movie. Rocky was filmed on $1 million in under a month and hit show earned $117 million in no time. Its popularity launched a franchise that has earned $1.5 billion worldwide, cementing Stallone’s place in Hollywood history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=titanic-1-8-billion>Titanic: $1.8 Billion</h2><p>James Cameron asks for an unprecedented $190 million to create an epic love story aboard the famous ocean liner. Stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet had not yet been behind a major blockbuster but all that changed. The industry had Titanic pegged as a very expensive flop, and it looked like they might be right when the film opened to a modest $28 million.</p><p>However, popularity grew and after 15 weeks at #1 at the box office, the movie had earned $600 million domestic and $1.8 billion worldwide, making it the most successful movie ever. Today, Titanic has earned $2.2 billion, the third highest grossing filming in history.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Filming For "The Batman" Will Be Finished In March [Report]</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TIME</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Screen Rant</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shortlist&nbsp;</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Looper</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTCr7HXqZycrJWZeqO4zpyim62jqbKzecyoraKdo2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
