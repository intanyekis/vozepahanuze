That’s the truth. My wife and I are working on our marriage and real work with @callmemrsshort #MyApologies.”</p><p>In the video, the&nbsp;Stomp The Yard&nbsp;star described accidentally scratching his wife’s hand while attempting to grab her phone and stated the police did not want to take him or his wife to jail.</p><p>In March 2018, Short <a href=# rel=nofollow>reportedly</a> pled no contest to allegedly hitting his wife during an incident in November 2017.
