Seeing dollar signs in every direction and being well aware of the fact that he is trending again, the artist has just announced that he is <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">launching a hot new ad campaign</a> for his OVO clothing brand, and this one includes a very special twist. If Drake-inspired clothing isn't enough to get fans excited, this fashion line happens to also be NBA inspired, and to pack a two-punch, Drake has also enlisted a very famous face to be the face of this campaign. Bobby Schmurda has been tapped as the model, and according to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">All Hip Hop</a>, fans can start shopping today!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kanye's Donda Vs Drake's Certified Lover Boy: Who Scored The Highest Sales</a></span></p><p>Bobby Shmurda is not the first person that fans would have pegged to front Drake's clothing campaign. The highly controversial artist has recently been released from prison after serving a six-year sentence for conspiracy, reckless endangerment, and gun possession charges and doesn't necessarily project the image that most would connect to a new product launch.</p><p>However, the <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wildly successful Drake</a> seems dedicated to backing Shmurda and is using his image in abundance as he appeals to his fans to purchase some of the items of his newly launched NBA-themed merchandise.</p><p>Drake could have easily kept the focus on himself. His millions of adoring fans would have surely responded well had he fronted the campaign on his own; however, his intentional plight to elevate Shmurda along with this campaign has been duly noted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two took the world by storm after posting an ad featuring Shmurda posing up while wearing the new clothing line. The New York Knicks-inspired clothing items are already up for grabs as of today, but pricing for the various items was not previously reported or released to the public.</p><p>Bobby Shmurda has stepped up to the plate by blasting his fans and followers with the news of this collaboration and has seen a positive response already. He took to Instagram to boast his involvement by posting the caption: "<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@Welcomeovo FW2021 — OVO® / NBA.</a>”</p><p>The items in this <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrity clothing brand</a> use the classic blue and orange colors of the team and include hats, jackets, sweatsuits, t-shirts, hoodies, and more. There's heavy New York influence when it comes to the stylistic accents of this new gear, and of course, the signature owl icon appears on all items.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All Hip Hop reports that; "the OVO x Knicks New Era cap has Drake’s brand’s signature owl iconography alongside a basketball in the basketball franchise’s colors. The varsity-style warm-up jacket features the Knicks’ logo on the upper left side of the garment, with a large OVO “O” patch opposite the orange logo on the upper right. Embroidered under the basketball team’s logo is World Champions 1970, 1973.”</p><p>This is yet another example of the <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">various income streams Drake has masterminded</a>, all of which contribute to his massive $200 million net worth.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">8 Luxury Brands Investing In Baby Clothing (& Why It's A Smart Move)</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">All Hip Hop</a>,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Instagram</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSxs63KnmSappRir7CuwbJkrKCdqr%2BlrYylmK6mk516onnHqKtmppWseq%2BuwGagp6ugnr%2BmsIyco6ismJ67qHnLoqWeZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
