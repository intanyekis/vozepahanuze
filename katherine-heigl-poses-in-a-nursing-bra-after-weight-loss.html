The Grey’s Anatomy alum directed her followers to her blog, <a href=#>Those Heavenly Days</a>, and revealed why she’s “very serious” about bras.</p><p>“When I was a VERY underdeveloped 14-year-old I actually prayed … and even fasted for a bigger bosom,” she recalled. “Not only did I end up with a B cup by that summer, by the following I was well on my way to the DD cup I ended up with.”</p><p>She added: “A word to the wise though. Make sure you’re very specific when setting those intentions. I forgot to mention that I’d like to skip the hips and ass of the well endowed. I also forgot to mention perky…ah well, can’t have it all right?”</p><p>On Monday, February 19, the actress showed off her toned body and revealed it took her more than a year to get in shape after <a href=#>giving birth to son Joshua</a> with husband <strong>Josh Kelley</strong> in December 2016. “It’s been almost 14 months since Joshua Jr was born and it has taken me about that long to really get back in shape,” Heigl wrote along with a three-picture collage. “The first pic was taken one month after he was born. The second pic was taken almost a full year later and the last pic was taken this weekend.”</p><p>Heigl revealed to her followers that she used trainer Kayla Itsines’ Bikini Body Guide and made major progress in just five weeks. “I wish I had a few from in between the first and second so you could really see how slow my progress was but alas…I was busy covering it all up those months, not posing in my unders!” the Ugly Truth star continued. “Anyway, I have a beach vacation coming up, a new job I start filming in April and my deep desire to feel fit, strong and sexy propelling me forward the last two months to finally loose the last of my baby weight and do a deep dive search for the ab muscles I knew were buried under that belly somewhere!”</p><p>Last month, it was revealed that Heigl will be joining Suits for season 8 after <strong><a href=#>Meghan Markle</a></strong> and <strong>Patrick J. Abrams</strong> left the USA series. The actress <a href=#>married Kelley in 2007</a> and the couple are also parents to adopted children Naleigh, 9 and Adalaide, 5.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGakmaSdsrO1zZ5koZ2ZnLluvM6snKxlmaN6onnNrqmsoZ6ceqO%2BwGaYn6yVp3q4scign61lnKTAtHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
