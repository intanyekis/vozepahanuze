We wish we could never squat again, but we’re always being told that they’re the best way to achieve a shapely behind. Sure, squats may help tone things up, but if you’re really looking for a lift, there’s an easier — and even more effective — way to make it happen. You just need the right pair of leggings!</p><p>If we’re calling a pair of leggings the “best,” that means it must expertly meet two criteria. One, the leggings have to be comfy enough for all-day wear, whether we’re working out or lounging around, and two, they must lift and shape so effectively that even <strong>Sir Mix-a-Lot</strong> would be sprung. Want to call a pair of leggings like that your own? Then check out our picks below, with pairs to fit everyone’s budget!</p><p><strong>SPANX Jean-ish Leggings</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/spanx-leggings.jpg><p>We’d say these leggings look just like your favorite pair of skinny jeans — but they honestly look even better.
