As a result, there are many examples of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">once-popular musicians who’ve been forgotten</a> for the most part in the years since their careers took off in a big way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thankfully for the members of The Spice Girls, it seems incredibly unlikely that the world will forget about them anytime soon. After all, the Spice Girls have managed to remain relevant more than two decades after they went their separate ways the first time. Amazingly enough, it has come out that because of that ongoing popularity, one of the members of the group has turned down five offers to pose for Playboy. With that in mind, it begs an obvious question, why did she pass on those opportunities?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bow Wow And 14 Other Rappers Nobody Cares About Anymore</a></span></p><h2 id=a-true-supergroup>A True Supergroup</h2><p>Throughout music history, girl groups have been a major force in the business. For example, groups like TLC, Destiny’s Child, Bananarama, The Pussycat Dolls, En Vogue, The Supremes, and Blackpink have all taken the music world by storm. Despite all of the success, those groups have enjoyed, their accomplishments pale in comparison to what The Spice Girls pulled off.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>An absolute phenomenon at the height of their careers, The Spice Girls managed to sell more than 90 million records worldwide. To put that accomplishment into the proper perspective, people bought so many Spice Girls records that they are among the best-selling artists of all time. In fact, The Spice Girls have often been compared to The Beatles in terms of sales figures and when you look at the numbers, that makes perfect sense.</p><p>On top of all the album sales that the Spice Girls enjoyed, the group also made a fortune from merchandise sales and they starred in a major movie. For all of those reasons, it is hard to overstate how successful the group was and it makes sense that it seems like interest in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Spice Girls reuniting</a> will never go away.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Spice Girls Pics That Define The '90s</a></span></p><h2 id=lots-of-offers>Lots Of Offers</h2><p>In the business world, deals fall through so regularly that the world rarely learns about possible agreements until they are in the final stages of negotiation. Similarly, when deals fall through in the entertainment and publishing industries, the masses rarely find out an offer was on the table, to begin with. However, some potential deals are so interesting that the press report about them even though they never come to pass.</p><p>Since the Spice Girls have enjoyed so much success around the world, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that the people at Playboy would love to have one of them pose for a pictorial. Despite that, none of the Spice Girls have posed for a Playboy photographer as of this writing. As it turns out, however, Playboy has tried to convince one of the Spice Girls to pose for them on multiple occasions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As of the time of this writing, it isn’t known if all of the Spice Girls have been asked to pose for Playboy in the past. However, according to a CNN article, Mel B has been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">asked to pose for Playboy five times</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Every Member Of The Spice Girls, Then And Now</a></span></p><h2 id=rejection-reasons>Rejection Reasons</h2><p>Unfortunately for anyone who would like to see Mel B pose for Playboy, that hasn’t happened to this day. While it is impossible to know whether or not this figure is accurate, it has been reported that Mel B even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">turned down a staggering £1 million offer</a> from Playboy. Considering how much money that is, at this point, many people may assume that it is extremely unlikely that Mel B will ever pose in the buff for Playboy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the past, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a major pop star turned down Playboy</a> because she didn’t want to be associated with the publishing company. According to what Mel B has said in the past, she doesn’t have some kind of aversion to Playboy. In fact, Mel B has said that she would consider posing for Playboy in the future on multiple occasions.</p><p>As for why Mel B hasn’t worked with Playboy up until now, she says it is solely because she feels <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the timing hasn’t been right</a> as of yet. “I did turn them down, but that's not to say I wouldn't consider it in the future. I have no problems walking around the house naked or anything." Since Mel B seems to be open to Playboy, it seems like only a matter of time before the company approaches her to pose for a pictorial yet again. But if trends say anything, it's unlikely that she'll accept.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Which Beloved Teen Star Turned Down $1 Million To Appear In Playboy?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdqbWqv4ysp6KblWK0qr7LZp%2Baq12pwrO6xJ1knaeno3qxuMCymaixXZu2t7GMraCmnaNk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
