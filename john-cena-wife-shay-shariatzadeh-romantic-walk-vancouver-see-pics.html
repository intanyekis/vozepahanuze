The couple, who’ve been <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>married for roughly seven months</a>, was spotted after getting some dinner in the stunning city. The former WWE star turned actor, 44, fashioned a pair of gray cargo shorts and a light jacket with a T-shirt underneath. John also maintained safety protocols by wearing a black protective mask over his mouth and nose amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/john-cena-and-his-wife-shay-backgrid-embed1.jpg><a href=#>The Suicide Squad</a> star’s incredible wife, 32, looked equally as casual and comfortable! The accomplished engineer sported a pair of leggings with comfy sneakers, a black top, and a cozy white and black sweater. Shay fashioned her hair by wearing it naturally and down, and also sported a black and white protective mask.<p id=content-paragraph-4>The couple looked absolutely adorable and so in love. Shay <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>held on tightly to John’s hand</a> as paparazzi snapped photos. John, however, got very playful with the photogs, throwing up a peace sign to the cameras during his stroll with Shay. Based on what fans could see from Shay’s expression, the move appeared to make her laugh!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/john-cena-and-his-wife-shay-backgrid-embed.jpg>Shay and John have truly been living on Cloud Nine since exchanging their wedding vows in October 2020. The two have been <a href=#>spotted out and about</a> on more than one occasion, holding hands and enjoying some low-key outings together. Of course, John’s approach to his marriage, the actor’s second, is definitely different than previous relationships.<p id=content-paragraph-6>“I can say with great confidence I’m extremely happy,” John teased about his relationship with Shay during a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>November 2019 interview</a>. “Well you know every experience in life is a chance for us to know who we are and who we‘re not and just because I went down one avenue in life doesn’t mean I’m going to repeat going down that avenue,” he shared, seemingly referencing his very public relationship and split from&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nikki Bella</strong></a>. Now, however, it seems that John is protecting his private life and keeping his marriage with Shay as personal and special as possible!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH12e5BpZqOnmKN6pLHNmmSwoZaaerS0wLJkrKCRp7aiwNmam56gXae8rq3NraCcZaeWuax51ZqlnKelq7KzedKenGaomZjAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
