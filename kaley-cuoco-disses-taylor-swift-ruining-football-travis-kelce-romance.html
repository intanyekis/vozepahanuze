News, Kaley admitted that she and her boyfriend Tom Pelphrey have become Taylor Swift fans by watching her at Travis’ games.</p><p>"Listen, this is a football house, OK? This is a classic football house. I'm Rams, my partner is Giants,” she explained. “But now it's all about…I'm like, 'Is Taylor at the game? Are we watching the Chiefs game. Is Taylor there? What's she wearing?'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Tom isn’t as thrilled that Taylor is getting so much attention when compared to the game. "He's like, 'Oh my God. This is supposed to be about football!" she continued.</p><p>For her, however, Kaley says, "I'm loving every second of it.”</p><p>Interestingly, not every celebrity has been thrilled to see Taylor at NFL matches. Bachelorette star Rachel Lindsay opened up about the subject on the podcast Behind the Table, <a href=#>where she said it was annoying</a>.</p><h2 id=other-celebrities-have-accused-taylor-of-being-a-distraction>Other Celebrities Have Accused Taylor Of Being A Distraction</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/taylor-swift-wearing-black-onstage.jpg><p>“There's no other emotion that comes out of me than hating it.,” Rachel explained. "People are coming to games wearing shirts that say 'Taylor Swift's boyfriend.' It's just a little disrespectful to the sport and to the game—and even to Travis Kelce."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"This is fantastic for him but I don't want to constantly see flashes of her with Donna Kelce in the suite and whatever famous friends [Taylor Swift] decides to bring,” the reality star continued.</p><p>Kelly Clarkson also found herself in hot water after she said her Taylor and Travis comments were taken out of context. In a similar vein to Rachel Lindsay, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelly said that Taylor’s appearance at NFL games has become a distraction.</a> "It’s not hilarious how it is literally taking over the NFL for people that like watching sports now," Kelly said earlier this month.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/how-taylor-swift-is-adding-to-her-current-740-million-net-worth-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Taylor Swift Is Adding To Her Current $1.1 Billion Net Worth</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift is a cultural icon and a financial powerhouse in the entertainment industry, who is now in the billionaires club.</span><p>"It’s like you’re watching 'Housewives' while you’re watching," the talk show host went on. "They’re just talking about gossip things and you’re like, so what about the play? But they’re taking over."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Kelly was criticized for being negative towards Taylor and Travis’ romance, she made a statement on social media advising her fans not to believe her words that were taken out of context.</p><p>"Do not fall prey to clickbait, trash reporters twisting the facts again. I did not bash anyone's romance," she wrote. "I am pro romance. Yay romance. Did y'all even watch what I actually said on my show? I just said I want to watch football when I tune in to watch football. Seems an appropriate request."</p><p>Taylor has been to four of Travis’ games and is expected to attend more as their romance seems to flourish, although it doesn’t seem to be to the delight of everyone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiimqSVrnqkwc6cpmacmajApr%2BMrZiypJ%2BnerTDyJ%2BrZqqlnruqusZmnainpJeurbiMramarpmoeqyxy5ycZqqfoq6vr8Ro</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
