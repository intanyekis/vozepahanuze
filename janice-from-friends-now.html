From Brad Pitt to Bruce Willis to Reese Witherspoon, so many&nbsp;friends also rubbed elbows in the acting world. 'Friends' producers even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">convinced Sean Penn to accept a guest cameo</a> in not one but two episodes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some actors on the show skyrocketed to fame after the iconic show ended, but one important character didn't. Janice, Chandler's one-time love, appeared in a whopping 19 episodes of the show. But as fans know, Chandler didn't end up with her.</p><p>Instead, Janice gets married to someone else. Though, she does come back to taunt Chandler afterward. Of course, what fans really want to know is what happened to the actress who played Janice.</p><p>If she looks familiar, there's a reason for it: Margaret Wheeler, AKA Maggie Wheeler, has been on countless other shows during her acting career.&nbsp;With over 70 acting credits, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>,&nbsp;both before and after 'Friends,' Maggie hasn't faded into oblivion.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Janice From Friends Has A Daughter Who Is Using Her Iconic Line On TikTok</a></span></p><p>And get this: the idea to have Janice laugh in a totally obnoxious way was all Maggie's idea. After all, someone had to be able to match the comedic level of Chandler Bing!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But fans weren't the only ones who loved Janice. While Maggie originally auditioned for the role of Monica, the producers wound up loving her portrayal of the sassy ex&nbsp;so much that the one-off character became a series staple.</p><p>More than 16 years later, "Janice" is still recognizable to devoted fans, even if the star behind her has moved on to other projects.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Maggie-Wheeler-Central-Perk.jpeg><p>As&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DailyMail</a> recently recapped, Maggie enjoyed her time on 'Friends' and is happy that her character's iconic line has become a meme (and more, if her daughter's TikTok videos are any indication).</p><p>She may not be one of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Friends' cast's highest-earning celeb guests</a>, but Maggie's illustrious career has kept her in the television sitcom spotlight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Along with her role in 'Friends,' Maggie Wheeler also appeared on 'Doogie Howser, M.D.,' 'The X-Files,' 'The Parent Trap,' 'Will & Grace,' 'Everybody Loves Raymond,' and even 'How I Met Your Mother.' She's also lent her voice to many animated films and TV shows.</p><p>Even though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew Perry had the final line on 'Friends,'</a> Janice was a character whose trademark line 'Oh my god' was never forgotten. Years after the show wrapped, Maggie Wheeler continues to be grateful for the opportunity the role afforded her.</p><p>She also noted that she's open to a cast reunion, noted&nbsp;DailyMail. Of course,&nbsp;fans have already been holding their breaths for ages, and it hasn't happened yet.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Friends' Celebrity Guest Stars Have Said About The Show</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihmqaZmLJustGopGaeop6yr7DSZqWor18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
