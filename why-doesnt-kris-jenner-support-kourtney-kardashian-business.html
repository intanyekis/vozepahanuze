Considering the Kardashian-Jenners' immense popularity and fan base, it's no wonder that when any of the sisters launch a new brand, it's going to be successful, whether it's beauty, fashion, or even gaming.</p><p>Like always, Kris Jenner is there to support her daughter, give business advice, make it profitable, and get a cut from its success.</p><p>When Kylie Jenner launched Kylie Cosmetics, Kris Jenner reportedly played a significant role in the brand, creating its marketing strategy, and being consistently involved in its development. Then, when Kim Kardashian launched KKW Beauty, Kris Jenner went to social media several times to promote it, being a key player in its success. She is also very involved in Khloé Kardashian's Good American, and she never misses showing off Kendall Jenner's campaigns, or the 818 Tequila brand on her social media.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it comes to Kourtney Kardashian, it seems that Kris Jenner has a different attitude.</p><h2 id=kris-jenner-promotes-most-of-her-daughters-39-brands>Kris Jenner Promotes Most Of Her Daughters' Brands</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/untitled-design-58.jpg><p>More than one decade ago, Kris Jenner saw the potential of Keeping Up With The Kardashians to make her family famous. Since then, not only the Kardashian-Jenner family but also everything that revolves around them attracts millions of eyes and significant media attention.</p><p>In other words, Keeping Up With The Kardashians helped boost the careers of the family members. The Kardashian-Jenner family has a history of entrepreneurship, and their various business ventures have contributed significantly to their success and fame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kris Jenner's Life Was Much Different Before Her Family Rose To Fame</a></span></p><p>After more than one decade since they secured their fame, the Kardashians still launch businesses that quickly become very successful. The first Kardashian-Jenner to launch a business was actually their mother, Kris Jenner, namely Jenner Communications in the early 2000s.</p><p>However, her daughters' businesses are far more successful, including Kim Kardashian's shapewear company Skims, Khloé Kardashian's Good American, Kylie Jenner's Kylie Cosmetics, Kendall Jenner's tequila brand, 818, and Kourtney Kardashian's lifestyle brand Poosh.</p><p>Since Kris Jenner is consistently involved in managing her daughters' careers, <a href=#>she also takes a 10% cut from all these businesses</a>. In terms of her involvement, Kris Jenner has a decision-making role in most brands' development, even taking a cut from Kourtney Kardashian's Poosh brand.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, when Kim and Kourtney Kardashian launched brands in the same period of time, Kris Jenner hyped Kim Kardashian's brand on her social media, subtly ignoring Kourtney Kardashian's Lemme brand.</p><h2 id=why-doesn-39-t-kris-jenner-support-kourtney-kardashian-39-s-lemme-brand>Why Doesn't Kris Jenner Support Kourtney Kardashian's Lemme Brand?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/untitled-design-59.jpg><p>Fans quickly noticed how Kris Jenner also promotes Khloé Kardashian's Good American on her social media but never posts anything related to Lemme. While some fans think Kourtney Kardashian is the one who distances herself from the family, others think Kris Jenner simply doesn't approve of Lemme.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>All Of Kris Jenner's Motherly Advice On Dating</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It must be a bad product if Kris said Lemme pass", wrote one fan, summarizing the overall <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">opinion on Kris Jenner not promoting Kourtney Kardashian's brand</a>, when compared to her sisters' businesses. They also suspect that Kris Jenner ignores Lemme on social media because of money, saying that "there’s a monetary incentive to promote Good American but none for Lemme."</p><p>Considering that Kris Jenner supported most of the Kardashian-Jenner businesses, <a href=#>either if they were successful or not</a>, money shouldn't be an issue.</p><h2 id=people-believe-kourtney-kardashian-is-kris-jenner-39-s-least-favorite-daughter>People Believe Kourtney Kardashian Is Kris Jenner's Least Favorite Daughter</h2><p>There might be another reason for Kris Jenner ignoring Lemme on social media, and this could be related to her favoritism within the family. Throughout the years, the Kardashian-Jenner clan has stuck together, no matter what happened.</p><p>Even if Kris Jenner had things to say about her daughters' romantic choices, these didn't intervene with her involvement in their businesses.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When being asked about <a href=#>Kravis' Vegas wedding</a>, Kris Jenner answered that Kourtney Kardashian is "coining a new phrase," and even she, her mother, doesn't really understand all the details.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kris Jenner Isn't Hollywood's Only Momager, These Parents Have Ran Their Celebrity Child's Career Too</a></span></p><p>This certainly shows that Kris Jenner and Kourtney Kardashian aren't the closest in the family. When people started noticing that Kris Jenner always promotes her other daughters' businesses on social media, but she never posts on Lemme, they suspected <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kourtney Kardashian might be Kris Jenner's least favorite daughter</a>.</p><p>Apart from ignoring Lemme, this came after Kris Jenner reportedly confessed that Kylie Jenner is her favorite daughter.</p><p>However, throughout the years, even the sisters mentioned that Kim Kardashian might actually occupy that role. In any case, Kourtney Kardashian doesn't reach the top of the list of Kris Jenner's preferences.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/untitled-design-60.jpg><p>Another incident attracted fans' attention when in 2022 both Kim and Kourtney Kardashian launched two businesses at the same time, and Kris Jenner had a very different and noticeable attitude toward them.</p><p>She reportedly hyped Kim Kardashian's equity firm, SKKY Partners, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">didn't even follow Kourtney Kardashian's Lemme brand</a> on social media. This wouldn't be the first time though when Kris Jenner seemed to take Kim Kardashian's side and apparently ignored Kourtney Kardashian.</p><p>It seems that when it comes to business, their relationship remains complicated. Even if Kourtney Kardashian is clearly not her favorite daughter, Kris Jenner not supporting Lemme is weird since she always focused on increasing her family's net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This time though, she doesn't seem interested in helping Lemme grow.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbymv82tZKSqmah6q7HNp5yrZaOqvbG70a1kpKelp8GvsdhmopqqlJbAqbXAp2SbraOeu6a%2F0mg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
