The heavy drums of Barker can also be heard in the background.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The video screams the early 2000s’ scene with aesthetic matching the punk-rock and emo bands like Green Day, My Chemical Romance, and Paramore. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Directed by Dana Trippe, in one scene, Smith is seen donning heavy black eyeliner and bondage pants and a grungy black and white dress with a giant spiked necklace in the next.</p><p>She is even seen shredding her electric guitar during the end of the music video.</p><p>With the vocal matching those of early Paramore's sound, the lyrics talk about how people have a fake facade they show to her, but she can see right through them because of their ‘transparent soul.’&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"Transparent soul, I can see right through just so you know," she sings in the chorus while smiling menacingly into the camera.&nbsp;</p><p>Smith had first teased the news of her upcoming song through an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a> post on April 25.

When we come in the presence of such a mirror-like soul, we can see both the beauty and ugliness of our inner life.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>As for her new pop-punk direction, the singer said she had always gravitated towards the rock scene because of the exposure while touring with her mother Pinkett Smith’s nu-metal band Wicked Wisdom.&nbsp;</p><p>Her mother’s powerful voice had always inspired her, but she could never tap into the same furious rock energy as her mom because of her training in the R&B and pop genre. But she later realized that it was not because of the voice but the insecurity of what others would think.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Adding to it, she also included Avril Lavigne and My Chemical Romance to the list of artists that had inspired her.</p><p>So when the pandemic hit, she finally dwelled on this new music she had always been drawn towards and started writing the songs for her new album.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>Reaction Of Fans</h2><p>The fans have been very supportive of the collaboration and Smith's ventures into the new genre of pop-punk.
