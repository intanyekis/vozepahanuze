Magazine</a>, the former reality star is appealing the court’s decision that Jon doesn’t owe her $132,000 in back due child support. Kate initially began fighting her ex for the money in 2018, but a court dismissed the case in November. However, Kate went on to appeal the decision, claiming she is owed the money.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/tr-dark.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Kate Gosselin Is Making A Comeback: 15 Things She'll Never Live Down</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Now we get to watch the 43-year-old look for “Mr. Right” on a new dating series Kate Plus Date.</span><p>A representative for Jon told the media that the father-of-eight was looking forward to being done with the legal battle, but it appears he’s still going to be seeing his ex-wife in court thanks to her appeal. But the rep claims it’s merely a desperate attempt for Kate to make money in difficult times.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Unfortunately, Kate can’t seem to let this go despite the judge’s decisions. This doesn’t look good for her. I’m sure the judges won’t take kindly to this," the rep claimed. "She is free now that all her children are in college. This seems like just another very desperate move to make money. I think it’s time for Kate to get a job."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/screen-shot-2023-12-18-at-8-33-43-am.png> Kate Gosselin and her daughters&nbsp;<p>Although Kate believes she’s owed child support, Jon has accused her of stealing from their children’s trust funds. <a href=#>He claims she withdrew $50,000</a> on two separate occasions, though Kate later defended herself, saying it was for necessary living costs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“You can’t just live off your kids’ money,” he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a> . “It makes me feel disgusted.”</p><p>“She has been on TV telling the world she has saved her children’s money when she’s actually been stealing from them-– she’s a hypocrite,” he went on, calling his ex’s actions “morally wrong.”</p><p>Even though Jon and Kate continue to argue over money, all of their eight children are nearly legal adults. Their oldest kids, twin daughters Maddy and Cara, have been living out of the house for years after beginning college. Four of the former couple’s sextuplets live with Kate, while the other two live with Jon and apparently have limited contact with their mom. Kate’s current net worth hasn’t been verified, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reports suggest it could be as high as $500,000</a> when considering all of her assets.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpJmkmnqou9KsnKWhnmKusbzEmqOsZZOkwrPAjJ2cp7FdZoB0fI9pZJygmaGxbr%2FUqaeoqqRk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
