At that time there wasn’t the massive amount of affiliate networks and it was no where near as easy to buy some licensing software and setup shop. Back then we had the big players like CJU, LinkShare, WebSponsors, BeFree and a few others. I also remember when the Sharesale network first came out and I really liked what I was seeing. So much, that after I pulled all my merchant programs off CJ, I loaded most of them onto Shareasale. I’ve been an advertiser and affiliate with them since the beginning.</p><p align=center></p><p>These days, there are just a massive onslaught of ad networks right in your face. With so much competition out there, how can they all last? Even just looking back 2-3 years ago when DirectTrack released their own operating system for running your own network, everyone in the world was starting their own! Even I had my own network for a few months! I couldn’t deal with the management and frustration of running a network on my own, so I said forget that!… but I can say that I tried it! Find a list of DirectTrack’s clients that were running their network software and I’m sure that most of them are out of business or never got to make it big. (Two examples of networks that have thrived using DirectTrack, are XY7 and CPAEmpire) Why is that? DirectTrack had a decent system for managing networks… but I’m sure the offers, competitive rates and affiliate support just wasn’t there.</p><p align=center></p><p>I really only use a handful of networks for the majority of my business. What matters to me more than anything else is getting the attention and support I deserve. If another network is paying 5% more on an offer, but I’m not already established with them… I don’t care. My personal relationship means all the difference. Just off-hand, five of my top preferred networks are. NeverBlueAds, PepperJam Network, RocketProfit, ValueClick Media & Shareasale. I’ve never had an issue with payment, I’ve always had someone personable at the company to work with, and I’ve made good money with all of them. What are your favorite affiliate networks and how can they better serve you?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiykZi3sLTNrKanZpOkunDDx5qrZpmimnq6u9SrZJ%2BZpqS%2FqsDEZpifnpmhtqLAxGalnqynpL%2Bsv4ywn7Jn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
