Just like Leonardo DiCaprio, the two-time Emmy winner has bought her father a $1.9 million home in the West Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles. The 3,391-square-foot residence, nestled on over a quarter of an acre, isn’t too far from the Encino estate she currently calls home.</p><p>Zendaya shares a close bond with her parents. Up until fairly recently, despite owning several homes of her own, the internationally famous actress (“Euphoria,” “Dune,” the “Spider-Man” franchise) was still living with either her father, Oakland native Kazembe Ajamu Coleman, or her mother Claire Stoermer; the pair divorced in 2016 but remain close “homies,” per Zendaya herself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/7F225125-71FF-4919-90BF-7828A4B80DD5.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Records reveal the 26-year-old has now followed in the footsteps of megastars like The Rock, Leonardo DiCaprio and Beyoncé in buying homes for her parents, dropping $1.9 million on a residence to be occupied by her father. The impressive home is tucked away in the far-flung suburban outskirts of Los Angeles, in the San Fernando Valley’s West Hills neighborhood near Woodland Hills and Calabasas, per <a href=#><i>Dirt</i></a>.</p><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED: </b><a href=#><b>The 8 Highest-Grossing Zendaya Movies, Ranked</b></a></span></p><p>Coleman’s new abode boasts five bedrooms and five bathrooms that have been recently renovated to give it a fresh, modern update. The home has a unique layout with two of the bedrooms on the first level (one of them is currently used as an office space) while the other three bedrooms are on the second level, including the primary suite. The gorgeous kitchen is the heart of the house with a center island that offers plenty of seating for anyone who wants to entertain the chef while they work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/4519690B-B45F-4E8F-830A-4E0E0811C72A.jpeg><p>Zendaya’s dad is going to enjoy all of the backyard activities in his new home, too. There is plenty of room to run around on the grassy area overlooking the mountains or take a dip in the cool pool on a hot summer’s day. It’s going to be the perfect spot for Zendaya to kick back and relax if she wants a quiet day with her family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/626DA88F-05B3-4CA7-9372-9278AC89D1CE.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Built in the 1990s, the two-story residence last sold in 2008 for $1.1 million and has been renovated since. The front door opens into a double-height foyer with walls painted a pale periwinkle, and there are new hardwood floors throughout the main level. Both the living and family rooms offer their own fireplaces, and the formal dining room has French doors offering direct access to the pool area. White quartz countertops and deep brown cabinets define the fully redone kitchen, which boasts eat-in bar seating and adjoins the family room.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/CC8767D6-6D1E-4674-9607-A9FE42644C32.jpeg><p>Other outdoor amenities include grassy front and backyards, a raised spa adjoining the home’s swimming pool, and a built-in barbecue center with a bar seating area. A covered loggia provides some al fresco respite from the oppressive San Fernando Valley heat, and for chilly nights there’s also a circular fire-pit ideal for making s’mores. The property is additionally tucked away within an upscale housing tract, where HOA dues of $205/month help cover a neighborhood security patrol and maintenance of park-like common areas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/70DB4280-A434-42FB-B801-464DA6A933FB.jpeg><p>In addition to her dad’s spiffy new digs, Zendaya maintains several other residences, including a New York City apartment and the first house she ever bought, a Mediterranean-themed place in L.A.’s Northridge community. But the most expensive property in her portfolio remains a $4 million hilltop compound in Encino.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/9D832153-A0FC-4F97-A2CD-3AE5CCBAF00C.jpeg><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT:</b><a href=#><b> Khloe Kardashian Reportedly Has To Undergo An Operation To Remove A Tumor From Her Face</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Dirt</a>, <a href=#>She Knows</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaznZ6ZrrqtjJussqtdlnpyeZhmpKKknJ68r3nCmqOinp%2Bnu6qtjJ2pnpmdYrWwwdKeZJ%2BnomK1pr6MnZidZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
