It’s getting cooler out and we’re ready to feel cozy, but we can always find ways to elevate <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">our loungewear</a>.</p><p>This <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">hoodie jumpsuit from </a><span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">PRETTYGARDEN</a> is exactly what we mean when we say elevated loungewear! It gives you a comfy ensemble all in one garment, and we think it’s cute enough to wear outside too!</span></p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">PRETTYGARDEN Women’s Long Sleeve Zip-up Hoodie Jumpsuit</a> for prices starting at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$24</a> on Amazon!

The smaller details are what make this jumpsuit as great as it is. We love the zip-up style that makes it super easy to throw on and show a little extra skin too. If you want to wear it without a top underneath, that’s totally doable, but you can also lower the zipper and wear it with a crop top underneath.</p><p>We also love that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">this jumpsuit</a> has an elastic waistband that cinches you in and gives you a more shapely silhouette! Without that elastic, this ensemble would look more like a set of PJs instead of a put-together outfit, which brings Us to how we would style it if we were to wear it out and about.</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">PRETTYGARDEN Women’s Long Sleeve Zip-up Hoodie Jumpsuit</a> for prices starting at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$24</a> on Amazon!

If it’s warm enough outside you can wear it alone, or if it’s chillier, you can throw on a leather moto jacket or jean jacket to provide an extra layer. Shoppers have actually said they intend on living in this outfit, and we feel the exact same way. The jumpsuit comes in a bunch of great colors — after you make your selection, get ready to live your best comfy life with this jumpsuit in tow!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">PRETTYGARDEN Women’s Long Sleeve Zip-up Hoodie Jumpsuit</a> for prices starting at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$24</a> on Amazon!
