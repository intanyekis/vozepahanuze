Seth tells us Larsa got an amazing deal on the pad paying under $1k per sq. foot is very low for a MIA penthouse.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED: </b><a href=#><b>Jon Favreau’s Newest $24 Million Laguna Beach Mansion</b></a></span></p><p>Larsa Pippen, ex-wife of Chicago Bulls legend Scottie Pippen, has also been spending time with Michael Jordan’s son, Marcus Jordan but she went on her East End tour with broker Shawn Elliott of Nest Seekers International, according to the <a href=#><i>Newyork Post</i></a><i>.</i></p><p>“All of my friends have homes here and I thought it would be a nice summer getaway,” Pippen told Gimme Shelter. “The community is amazing, and I love that it is so close to the city. It’s super fun, with all the shopping and restaurants, and you can have a little bit of everything here.”</p><p>After stopping off for lunch at Sant Ambroeus in Southampton — “I love that place,” she said — one of the homes she eyed was an off-market manse in Water Mill. The nine-bedroom beach mansion, at 439 Cobb Road, was last on the market for almost $19 million with a different brokerage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At 12,500 square feet, the residence, built in 2018, features a chef’s kitchen, four fireplaces, a home theater, a wine cellar, a library and a gym. The classic, gated home sits on 2 acres, and comes with a pool, a pool house and a tennis court.</p><p>“She loved filming in the Hamptons last summer and is interested in buying her own house here. She especially loves the way every hamlet is different, with its own personality,” Elliott said.</p><p>Florida had been her home base until she sold her Fort Lauderdale mansion last fall for $10.5 million and moved to California.</p><p>Pippen adds that, for now, she plans to continue her house hunt in the Hamptons, not the city.</p><p>“I like the Hamptons more than the city. It’s a better fit. It’s also not just for the summer anymore. A lot of my friends are spending more and more time there, including over the holidays.”</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT: </b><a href=#><b>Poppy Montgomery Sued $48,000 By Former House Helper For Unpaid Wages</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>The Newyork Post</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmalmaKorm68yKmnnqajYrumw4xsZGxlnZ65rbXOp2SmoZGitm68xKeroaelqLJw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
