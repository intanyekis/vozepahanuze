His jaw just dropped open,” said Bartholomew. “But this is actually a very typical type of sighting.”</p><p>The witness, who asked not to be named due to possible ridicule, described the creature to Bartholomew as black and hairy with two legs, wide shoulders and a small neck, he said.</p><p>Sightings of Sasquatch crossing a road are the most common upstate and are usually reported in August and September, according to Bartholomew.</p><p>“Whether it’s a migration I’m not sure. But there’s a real consistency with the reports. People will be driving at night — and they describe seeing the same thing,” he said. “A forest road is the most likely a place for a person to have the opportunity to see the creature.”<br>A similar ape-like animal was reported half a mile away in September 2006. Hundreds more sightings have been reported in the area over the years, he said.</p><p>On Tuesday, the driver wasn’t able to snap a photo of the beast because it happened “too quickly,” he said. The animal left no footprint due to the rugged terrain.</p><p>Bartholomew and some scientists believe the animal may be a descendant of an ancient southern ape.</p><p>“There’s a rich history here,” Bartholomew said. “In the 70s this was a taboo but the subject is gaining traction.”</p><p>Last month, the village of Whitehall announced Bigfoot as its official animal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlfnl7j3Fmamtfmb%2BqwsSrZKyon6nAbq7IoJ2op6RixKK4yqKloGWRmL%2Bwv9Jmqa6qkaF6qbXGoa6asV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
