For almost a century or more, we have thought about the great beyond and the possibility of life in outer space. And Major <strong>David Grusch</strong> claims that the USA has been aware of these non-human and UFO activities from as early as the 1930s!</p><p>The whistleblower and a former US Air Force intelligence officer, David, came forth with a shocking tale. While many remain skeptical about extraterrestrials, Maj. Grusch of the US Air Force became somewhat of a beacon of hope to many believers. If David's claims are true, then the United States of America has been lying about UAP for almost a hundred years!</p><h2>Maj. David Grusch Recent Testimony Tells The US Conceals A ‘Multi-Decade’ program that captures UFOs!</h2><p>As a retired US Air Force Major, David Grusch does have a pretty heavy impact on the topic. Moreover, the ex-military personnel brought forth the longstanding US secret project. Grusch came forward with his testimony on <i>July 26, 2023</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/7/27/Major%20David%20Grusch%20talked%20about%20the%20UAP%20and%20UFO%20retreval%20projects-1690451349191.jpg><p>On above stated date, the American Congress held a hearing regarding the UFO/UAP. (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) Many believers stayed glued to their seats on David's testimony at the hearing.</p><p>David's testimony raised many eyebrows. And not just regarding UFOs or extraterrestrials. The said hearing also pointed at the government's transparency with the taxpayers.</p><h2>Maj. David Grusch's Experience With National Reconnaissance Office!</h2><p>On the UFO Hearing, Maj. David Grusch spilled the beans on his time with the <a href=# rel=nofollow>National Reconnaissances Office</a>. Likewise, Grusch recalled that in 2019, he was called in by the head of a Gov taskforce on UAP. The ex-military man was called in to identify some highly classified programs on UAP.</p><figure class=media></figure><p>David went on and claimed that while his time in the National Reconnaissance Office, he was informed about the multi-decade UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering program. However, the higher-ups denied access to the program to Grusch.</p><p>The former US Air Force officer also <a href=# rel=nofollow>submitted evidence</a> to the hearing along with his testimony. However, the said proof of his claims stays behind the curtains. Grusch also stated that Pentagon has covered up multiple incidents with UFOs.</p><p>While David shared his testimony, the Pentagon denied the ex-military's claims of a cover-up. While no little green men or an actual UFO/UAP were brought forth in the hearing, David and his fellow testimonies remain adamant that UFOs or UAPs are beyond what we are currently capable of.</p><h2>Who is David Grusch the whistleblower?</h2><p>The former Air Force officer David Grusch, currently in his mid-30s, is Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania native. His testimony holds a massive weight because of his accomplishments in the military. Likewise, due to the sensitive nature of his fame much about Grusch's info remains hidden.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/7/27/David%20Grusch%20at%20the%20UFO%20UAP%20hearing%20on%20July%2026%202023-1690451413772.jpg><p>David is a decorated officer from the war in Afghanistan. Moreover, the UFO/UAP whistleblower is also a National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency veteran. And as mentioned above, he worked with the National Reconnaissance Office.&nbsp;</p><p>As mentioned earlier, Grusch keeps his life away from the limelight. Moreover, David is under whistleblower protection. So it's understandable that he and along with his family remain anonymous.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqaYo6eiYrGiwsidZKCqpaiwqXnCqKWfoaKiwG7Ax5qrZq2jYrivu9asZJqan6rBbq3LopynZZGYwarCyK2gnqs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
