He shares his youngest child with ex-girlfriend <strong>Kristin Grannis</strong>.</p><p>Over the years, Foxx has reflected on being a girl dad, detailing what it is like to see his children grow up into young women.</p><p>“Your daughters are special, man. Your daughters are special. And as a father you want that person who is dating your daughter to know that there will quite possibly be a chance that they won’t survive life,” the Law Abiding Citizen star joked during an April 2021 appearance on <a href=#>E!’s Daily Pop</a>.</p><p>Foxx teased that making his kids’ potential suitors fearful <a href=#>is part of his job</a> as he recalled meeting one of Corinne’s childhood flames.</p><p>“First of all, I’m a private eye and so by the time [Corinne] got the person there, I already knew everything about him,” he said of his eldest child’s first date. “This is so surreal, <a href=#><strong>Snoop [Dogg]</strong></a> was at my house. So she brings the guy by, to the crib, and I say, ‘Yo Snoop, there he is right there. Shake him up.’”</p><p>The<a href=#> In Living Color alum</a> remembered the “Drop It Like It’s Hot” rapper telling the boy, “Hey, what’s up, nephew? You understand what’s going on right now?”</p><p>While Foxx’s shenanigans haven’t kept him from having a close bond with Corinne, his tactics did inspire her 2021 Netflix series, <a href=#>Dad Stop Embarrassing Me!</a> The show was inspired by the model’s formative years and featured Foxx as one of the actors.</p><p>“From being a flower girl on <a href=#>The Jamie Foxx Show</a> to cohosting Beat Shazam together to now writing and producing a Netflix show about our lives, I couldn’t ask for a better person to navigate this industry with,” the former Miss Golden Globes <a href=#>wrote via Instagram in December 2020</a>. “But more importantly, I couldn’t ask for a better father to guide me, support me and always have my back. There’s so much more to come from us. I hope the world is ready for it. I love you Dad ❤️.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Soloist star’s youngest daughter, <a href=#>Anelise</a>, stays out of the spotlight a little more.
