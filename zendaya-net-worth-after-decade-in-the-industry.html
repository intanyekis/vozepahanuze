As such, she has managed to amass a $22 million fortune. And with 'Euphoria' being greenlit for a third season, in conjunction with two films that are completed and waiting for the SAG-AFTRA strike to end to be released, (<strong>including 'Dune 2', where Zendaya has a much larger role than the first</strong>) it appears that Zendaya's net worth is only going to increase for years to come.</p><h2 id=zendaya-39-s-start-with-disney>Zendaya's Start With Disney</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar40632880-1.jpg><p>Zendaya has made it clear that she is a force to be reckoned with! The star first began her career out as a theater actor and backup dancer before landing herself the role of Rocky Blue on Disney Channel's Good Luck Charlie. That role was later parlayed to Shake It Up, with Zendaya having a starring role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shake It Up provided Zendaya with three seasons' worth of experience, exposure, and of course, a nice salary. Once the show came to an end, Zendaya quickly moved on to yet another Disney show, KC Undercover.

And her first big role found her co-starring with Zac Efron and Hugh Jackman in The Greatest Showman.</p><p>The success of The Greatest Showman and Disney led Zendaya to work as a voice actor in a couple of films. But it was when she was cast as MJ in the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> film, Spider-Man alongside <a href=# rel=nofollow>Tom Holland</a> that Zendaya's career took on a whole new trajectory.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Being part of the mega movie franchise helped increase her wealth tenfold. <strong>While she was comfortably sitting at $5 million prior to her success with Marvel</strong>, the further success that Zendaya had with Spider-Man opened doors to blockbuster movies that only increased her wealth.</p><p>Those films include:</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>Spider-Man: No Way Home</p></td><td><p>2021</p></td><td><p>MJ (Starring Role)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dune</p></td><td><p>2021</p></td><td><p>Chani (Supporting Role)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Space Jam: A New Legacy</p></td><td><p>2021</p></td><td><p>Lola Bunny (Voice)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Malcolm & Marie</p></td><td><p>2021</p></td><td><p>Marie (Starring Role)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Spider-Man: Far From Home</p></td><td><p>2019</p></td><td><p>MJ (Starring Role)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Smallfoot</p></td><td><p>2018</p></td><td><p>Meechee (Voice)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Duck Duck Goose</p></td><td><p>2018</p></td><td><p>Chi (Voice)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>The Greatest Showman</p></td><td><p>2017</p></td><td><p>Anne Wheeler (Starring Role)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As if landing great roles in films was not enough to increase Zendaya's net worth, she also landed a starring role in the hit series, Euphoria.

This is because while the drama in the show deals with teenagers, the storyline is dark. As such, older crowds come flocking to watch, which has led to the continuing success of Euphoria.</p><p>The hit show managed to out-perform Big Little Lies and Barry on HBO. The first season alone, there were over 2.3 million viewers tuning in to watch. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">But by the second season, 16.3 million viewers were tuning in for each episode</a>. The only show that outperformed Euphoria on HBO was Game of Thrones.</p><p>Some of the added success from the show came from the fact that Zendaya won an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">becoming the youngest winner in that category</a>.</p><p>With Euphoria greenlit for Season Three, there is no telling just how much Zendaya will be paid to return to her Emmy-winning role.
