In September 2023, the 12-time Grammy winner broke the internet when she attended the game of <a href=#>her boyfriend Travis Kelce</a>, who is a tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs.</p><p>Their romance started when Kelce watched <a href=#>Swift's record-breaking Eras Tour</a> and failed to give her his number. The athlete revealed that the Cruel Summer songstress "doesn't talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings."</p><p>Fast-forward to 2024, the couple are still together and even spent New Year's Eve together in Kansas City. But while they seem to be happy, fans aren't pleased with the "Taylor Swift Curse" that's allegedly plagued the Chiefs. Here's the singer's real impact on the NFL.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar52888461-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Travis Kelce Admits He Scrambled To Delete Old Tweets Amid Publicity From Taylor Swift Romance">Travis Kelce Admits He Scrambled To Delete Old Tweets Amid Publicity From Taylor Swift Romance</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Travis' history is coming back to haunt him as he's been thrown into the spotlight thanks to his high-profile romance with Taylor.</p><h2 id=the-nfl-made-122-million-in-brand-value-from-the-quot-taylor-swift-effect-quot>The NFL Made $122 Million In Brand Value From The "Taylor Swift Effect"</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/taylor-swift-bonds-with-travis-kelce-s-mom-at-nfl-game-while-he-flirts-with-her-online.jpg><p>In October 2023, MarketWatch reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift created a brand value of $122 million for the NFL</a>. That was just from the day she went on Kelce's game alongside his mom. The couple left together after the event, as seen in a viral clip.</p><p>The Chiefs won over the Chicago Bears (41-10) that night. As a result, the NFL changed their Twitter/X bio to "we had the best day with you today" — a line from Swift's song The Best Day from her second studio album, Fearless (2008).</p><p>Three days later, there was a 175% increase in sales on the ticketing platform, Stubhub. It was for the Chiefs-Jets game, which is now the second-highest selling game of the NFL season. They also had over 24 million viewers – the most-watched NFL broadcast of that week.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In January 2023, the NFL's regular season viewership unexpectedly decreased by 3%.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:00</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/taylor-swift-mtv-awards-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Some Fans Are Convinced Taylor Swift Will Announce A Pregnancy In 2024 ">Some Fans Are Convinced Taylor Swift Will Announce A Pregnancy In 2024</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>There's a growing debate online whether Taylor even wants kids or not, considering how successful her career is at the moment.</p><h2 id=experts-said-travis-kelce-could-earn-5-million-more-since-dating-taylor-swift>Experts Said Travis Kelce Could Earn $5 Million More Since Dating Taylor Swift</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screen-shot-2023-03-05-at-9-21-26-am.jpg><p>Two days after Swift showed up at Kelce's game in September 2023, Business Insider wrote that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the footballer could earn $5 million more</a> since dating the Love Story hitmaker.

"It's estimated Kelce currently makes around $5 million a year in off-the-field earnings, and I wouldn't be surprised if he doubles that number," said sports analyst Bob Dorfman at Pinnacle Advertising.</p><p>"Kelce was already one of football's most successful endorsers before his hot romance, but now he's sizzling hot — swiftly grabbing the attention and buying power of a whole new fan base and demographic," he added.</p><p>OpenSponsorship CEO, Ishveen Jolly, also noted that "we are already seeing more interest in brands around Travis because he's tapping into a new audience of Taylor's." Icon Source's CEO Chase Garrett, went on to state that "sometimes, these moments can be distracting to an athlete, but with the proper structure in place, it is a great opportunity to maximize a moment for deal flow."</p><p>Travis Kelce's net worth is $40 million, the amount Taylor Swift makes from just four shows of her Eras Tour.

By Christmas, the Chiefs had lost four of their last five games. Fans called it the "Taylor Swift Curse." The team also faced controversy after quarterback, Patrick Mahomes had a couple of meltdowns on the field that month, with Kelce joining him on the second one.</p><p>on Christmas Day, Kelce and Mahomes slammed their helmets to the ground after their 20-14 loss to the Las Vegas Raiders. The latter was was then fined $50,000 after yelling at the offensive linemen. Disappointed fans joked, "Patrick Mahomes meltdown 👀 The curse of Taylor Swift." A Twitter user even reminded fans that Swift cursed the NBA, too:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Taylor Swift curse: she doomed teams in the NBA (when she visits and as long as she stays - local teams lose), she has ruined the Chiefs (Kelce can't catch and they’ll be on the road for the first time since Mahomes started)."</p><p>But for NFL staff writer, Matt Verderame, the team should be held accountable for Mahome's outburst. "The Chiefs have shattered Patrick Mahomes. This offense is an embarrassment to the sport," he tweeted. "KC has serious soul-searching to do after it quickly gets bounced from the playoffs."</p><p>A week after Taylor Swift's first-ever visit to Travis Kelce's game, the NFL's ratings went down due to "Taylor Swift Fatigue."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1llZuzpq%2FTZp%2Bor12iwqS0jKamp52pYrGqsIytn55lnpu5brnApJxo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
