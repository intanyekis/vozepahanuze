Marilyn is a former court judge best known for being a part of the TV series “The People’s Court”. She is the first Latina arbitrator on the show and also the longest active arbitrator in the series.

As of mid-2016, sources inform us of a net worth that is at $18 million, mostly earned through her success on television.
