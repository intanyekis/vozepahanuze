However, Karyn was too wise to fall for that.</p><p>"She knew better than that – good call, K.P.,” Will concluded.</p><p>For her part, although she rejected Will Smith's advances while they worked together, Karyn Parsons only has good things to say about her co-star.

It's infectious, whatever he's feeling or doing."</p><p>She continued by saying that it was both a surprise and not quite a surprise for her that he became a star.</p><p>"He's very magnanimous, loving, and just great energy," she concluded.</p><p>Falling for Karyn wasn't the first time Will tried to date one of his co-stars.
