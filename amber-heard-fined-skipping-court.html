The producers are reportedly suing Heard for $10 million dollars, claiming that she not only made changes to the script but also failed to finish voice-over work. Heard is counter-suing the filmmakers for supposedly violating a nudity clause in her contract.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>PREVIOUSLY: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">THINGS AMBER HEARD WANTS HIDDEN ABOUT HER TIME WITH JOHNNY DEPP</a></strong></p><p>Both parties were due to appear at the deposition earlier this week but the former Mrs. Depp failed to show. She has been sanctioned almost $7,000 dollars for wasting the courts time. According to the production company, Heard also deliberately sabotaged the film and its chances of success by refusing to film certain scenes they deemed pivotal to the plot, and failing to adequately promote it. On the other hand, Heard insists that the company was so intent on having intense sex scenes that they hired a body double for a "producer's cut."</p><p>Heard is no stranger to standing before a judge, since her drawn out and very public separation from superstar actor Johnny Depp which was finalized in February 2017. The Aquaman actress accused her former husband of being both physically and verbally abusive. While Depp denied this was the case, the divorce was eventually settled with the agreement that the actor would donate $14 million dollars to charity in Heard's name.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to recent reports, the <a href=#>Pirates of the Caribbean</a> veteran is in serious hot water financially, squandering his once considerable fortune on a lavish lifestyle that isn't maintainable. Sources state that the 53-year-old may have to sell his home to clear some considerable debt reaching into the millions. Considering that Depp has been one of the most bankable stars for the majority of his career, his personal affairs are highly speculated on by the media.</p><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AWFUL THINGS JOHNNY DEPP WANTS YOU TO FORGET</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmm62qr3yiucGeqWaglZa%2FpXnFoqWenF2ouKq8z6KloGWTpMKzwI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
