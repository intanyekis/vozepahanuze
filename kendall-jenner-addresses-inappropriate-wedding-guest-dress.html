I’m embarrassed for you. #cringe,” one user wrote. A few fans came to the model’s defense, with one user writing, “If the bride herself doesn’t gaf why do you care? relax.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Perez then got in on the action. “Tell em,” she wrote. “SHE LOOKED STUNNING AND I LOVED IT!”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp; </span>And once the bride clapped back at the haters (in the nicest way possible), the Keeping Up With the Kardashians alum entered the chat. “@laurenperez obvi asked for your approval in advance too.
