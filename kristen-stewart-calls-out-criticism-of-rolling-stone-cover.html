But f–k you.”</p><p>Stewart’s passion and profanity earned a handshake from Colbert before Stewart added, “But I never will!”</p><p>Colbert laughed, telling Stewart, “I think that’s why they’re mad at you.”</p><p>After the cover was released last month, Stewart immediately pushed back against its detractors during an appearance at the <a href=#>Berlin International Film Festival</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“The existence of a female body thrusting any type of sexuality at you that’s not designed for exclusively straight males is something people are not super comfy with,” Stewart said at a February 18 press conference, “and so I’m really happy with it.”</p><p>The star urged cooler heads to prevail when it comes to pushing boundaries, saying, “It’s OK to take different pictures and mix them up in a way that people aren’t used to.”</p><p>“In fact, it’s pervasive and it’s everywhere and it’s being denied and it’s crazy that there aren’t more pictures like that,” she added. “I loved the opportunity.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakqpmowaa6jKyrnq%2BRp8Fur8Clo6xln6rBbq%2FRoquim5moum67xWapqKScnruoedKtpqedXZi8t7HRaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
