Sandy steps in and <a href=#>asks to see both stew in the captain’s bridge.</a></p><p>“You haven’t given her a fair chance. I can’t tolerate this,” Sandy tells Natalya before addressing Tumi, “You’re in a leadership role and you need to rise above because right now I am ready to put you both off the boat.”</p><p>The tension between the stews <a href=#>has been at an all time high since Tumi joined the boat</a> ahead of the second charter. She was previously stuck in immigration — with <a href=#><strong>Kyle Viljoen</strong></a> — while Natalya filled in as the chief stew. After Tumi came onboard, <a href=#>she immediately ended up at odds with Natalya.</a></p><p>“Clearly she did a great job on the charter and I would be excited to work with someone like that. But also, how would she like it if someone started going off the way she did in the beginning? I am sure she wouldn’t like it at all,” Tumi told cameras in the beginning of the episode. “Be kind but don’t let them walk all over you.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Below-Decks-Captain-Sandy-Considers-Taking-Tumi-and-Natalya-Off-the-Boat-1.jpg><p>Following a tense first meeting, Natalya shocked her coworkers <a href=#>by referring to Tumi as “a f—king bitch.”</a></p><p>“She needs to appreciate the fact that I set up the flow and the boat is in a good place. There is a correct way to step into this role and it is to have a respectful hand over and come in with good energy,” she added.</p><p>Viewers have previously <a href=#>seen Natalya get combative with her chief stew <strong>Natasha Webb</strong></a> and Kyle during season 7 of Below Deck Med. Kyle, who returned as a second stew, warned Tumi about his past with Natalya. Following her heated conversation with Natalya, Tumi updated Kyle on <a href=#>where they currently stand before he rounded out the interior crew</a>.</p><p>“Giving you a heads up b/w us. I know you’re mates with her, but Nat needs to stay in her lane bc Tumi losing her s—t will end up in her walking off bc she had a diva moment,” Tumi wrote to Kyle, who responded, “I’m sorry to hear this — I did tell you she’s something that came for all of us.”</p><p>Later in the episode, things got even worse when Kyle repeated to Natalya <a href=#>what Tumi said about letting her go</a>. Their behavior started to bubble up until they got into an argument while there were guests on the Mustique.</p><p>“Stop talking back to me. You have been attacking me since day 1,” Tumi told Natalya. “I am a first time chief stew but I do know what I am doing. She has no respect — she reminds me of a chihuahua. Territorial, commutative and speaks all the time. I’ve had it with this, we are done.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In response, Natalya said she felt that Tumi<a href=#> didn’t want to start off on the right foot</a>. “You stepped on board with the worst attitude. There was no appreciation,” she noted. “So you can come handle it [with me but] don’t talk to Kyle about it. Talk to me about it.”</p><p>Below Deck Mediterranean airs on Bravo Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmepJ%2BseqWxwqSqZpuRpcGitc1mqpqmlK56pLvNrKCdnaKoerOxzKitoqaXYsG2uchmpZqskaHGonnDrpxmrJ9is6bBw2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
