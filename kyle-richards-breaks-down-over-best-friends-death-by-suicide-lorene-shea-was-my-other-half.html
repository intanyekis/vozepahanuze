I just never imagined that something like this could happen. Never.”</p><p>On top of the massive loss, the mom of four explained that 2022 was a particularly challenging year due to her<a href=#> estrangement from her eldest sister, Kathy Hilton</a>, as well as <a href=#>her crumbling marriage</a> to Mauricio Umansky.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized">“I just never imagined that something like this could happen. Never,” the Bravolebrity told producers about her best friend’s suicide.</figure><p>“What always kept me feeling safe and grounded was my marriage, so not feeling like I had that either, all at the same time is a lot,” she commented.</p><p>The “Halloween Kills” star then explained to her life coach that a lot of her life changes –– like not drinking and working out more –– have been to help her “feel safe again.”</p><p>“I’m just trying to surround myself around people that I love and love me and support me and only want the best for me, and I only want the best for them,” she told him. “I’m just trying to do all the things that are gonna help me feel stronger and it’s been working.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">“I don’t know what happened, because she was so together,” Richards said while crying. <span class=credit>kylerichards18/Instagram</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">The mom of four explained that she’s still trying to “feel safe” after the loss. <span class=credit>kylerichards18/Instagram</span></figure><p>Richards initially <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">posted about losing</a> her “kind, thoughtful, funny, smart, beautiful , sentimental” friend a week after Shea’s death in May 2022.</p><p><strong>For more Page Six reality TV updates</strong></p><p>“We would laugh until we cried , call each other out & be there for each other no matter what was going on in our lives,” she wrote at the time.</p><p>Richards added that her friend suffered from “debilitating depression” and the “system made it impossible to get her the help she needed.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">Shea died by suicide in May 2022. <span class=credit>kylerichards18/Instagram</span></figure><p>A little over a year after Shea’s death, Richards <a href=#>hosted an event with the National Alliance on Mental Illness</a> to raise awareness for mental health and pay tribute to Shea.</p><p>“I wanted to honor her and bring everyone together here tonight and raise awareness and funds because I really want people to know that there is help out there,” she told Page Six at the time.</p><p><strong>If you or someone you know is affected by any of the issues raised in this story, call or text the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiokZyytLXXZ5qopV9nfXN%2FjmppaGllZLKvwMSrq5qhnqKyr8COpLClnV2ntqS0wKubrGWSp7Kit9Jmm6ivnmK8t7HRZpmeq6Ris7O1xKebrGWUmq61tIybsGarpZ6wqrDEZqOoqpWjsm6%2Fx56YZq%2BRqHquxYyoq6GdomK1orjFaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
