Notably, he was the first overall pick in the 2005 draft.</p><p>Sidney is believed to be one of the greatest hockey players of all time and has been one of several players called “The Next One.” The nickname is usually given to players who are considered the next “Wayne Gretzky.” Wayne Gretzky is largely considered the greatest hockey player of all time and his nickname was “The Great One.”</p><p>Some other players including Phil Kessel, Eric Lindros, Connor McDavid, Paul Kariya, John Tavares have also been nicknamed “The Next One.” Ironically, none of the players dubbed the “The Next One” has managed to beat any of Wayne Gretzky’s records as of now. Like his career, Sidney’s personal life is quite interesting and is filled with chapters that would warm your heart. Keep scrolling to find out more.</p><h2><strong>Is Sidney Crosby Married?</strong></h2><p>When it comes to Crosby’s personal life, it will be surprising to find out that the hockey star has not been in many relationships to date. Although he is yet to walk down the aisle, Crosby has been dating a lady named Kathy Leutner. Sidney and Kathy are currently in a serious relationship, and despite being together for over a decade, the two have kept a low profile.</p><p>The couple is known for their notoriously private life which often leaves their fans and the media sniffing for the latest information on their relationship. The lovebirds met way back in 2008 through a mutual friend. Since then, its been an interesting romantic experience for the two. Sidney and his girlfriend currently reside in his Halifax, Nova Scotia home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Kathryn-and-Sidney.jpg><p>Born on December 13, 1987, Kathy is the same age as her boyfriend who was also born in 1987. These two are so much in love with each other and share a bond that leaves their fans in awe. Of course, expectations are that the couple would tie the knot at any moment. But who knows they just might be very comfortable the way they are.</p><h2><strong>What Does Crosby’s Girlfriend Kathy Do For a Living?</strong></h2><p>Like Crosby, Kathy Leutner is also popular. She is a professional model whose career spans over a decade in the modeling industry. Kathy has been on the cover of several top-notch magazines and has also modeled for many notable fashion brands. Like many famous names in the industry, Kathy was discovered by a scout at a very young age. At the time, she was 18, and it all happened in a mall.</p><p>The most interesting part of her story is that modeling was among the last things on her mind at the time. She was more interested in sports and wanted to venture into Lacrosse. But then, on a certain day, she went shopping with her mother, she was spotted by a scout in a mall, and sooner than later a whole new chapter was opened.</p><p>Since the inception of her career, Kathy has worked with notable brands, including Abercrombie & Fitch, Naked & Famous, and many others.

Leutner, no doubt, makes a lot of money from her career and sits on a reputable pedestal among her counterparts.</p><h2><strong>Background Information on His Family</strong></h2><p>Sidney Patrick Crosby was born to Tina and Troy Crosby on the 7th of August, 1987 at Grace Maternity Hospital&nbsp;in&nbsp;Halifax, Nova Scotia.
