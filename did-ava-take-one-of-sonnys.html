I agree, now her fingerprints are on the bottle, and that might mean this will be discovered soon and Ava will be blamed.</p><p><span class=post-likes>8 Likes</span></p><p>And the way she was smelling his cologne? I think she has developed real feelings. I do like the idea of Ava being wrongly accused because it will make the character a little more sympathetic.</p><p><span class=post-likes>8 Likes</span></p><p>Exactly. It will need to be discovered soon to make sense. I’m relieved because as amazing as Mo is at portraying an unraveling Sonny, I don’t think I could enjoy that very long. It’s all a little too real knowing the actor’s history. It becomes unsettling & I just start to worry about Maurice.</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p>I won’t be mad if when it is all said and done Ava and Sonny are together despite their history they make more sense to me,Nina never really fit with him and his days with Carly are way over with</p><p><span class=post-likes>6 Likes</span></p><p>I think her being wrongly accused will only help…but I will also need confirmation that Morgan isn’t dead and THEN I may just believe they are perfect for each other.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>I thought everybody who’s an adult knew you never take somebody’s medicine. Shaking my head at this one.</p><p><span class=post-likes>7 Likes</span></p><p>Seriously! Maybe you take a Tylenol PM you find…but something like Lithium? Silly. Besides, Ava would just get out the vodka bottle.</p><p><span class=post-likes>7 Likes</span></p><p>She took two pills. It’s a muscle relaxant and has nothing to do with his bipolar disorder.</p><p><span class=post-likes>6 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Cpa77</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>April 10, 2024, 10:55pm <span itemprop=position>13</span></span><p>Wait, when did that happen?</p><p>Thank you Nurse!</p><p>Well then, her fingerprints on the bottle aren’t going to lead anywhere…?</p><p>Now I have no idea what the purpose was</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>You’re right… good catch. Ava took a muscle relaxant not Sonnys Lithium used for bi-polar medication.<br>I wonder if this was intentional by the GH writers or they thought we fans wouldn’t catch it and think that it’s Sonnys bipolar meds.<br>Its pretty dumb of Ava taking not one but two of those pills plus drinking Alcohol.<br>We do know now that Ava is not a part of the drug scheming plan of Valentin yet.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>No, she didn’t take a lithium. She took a Lorphenadine! This is a muscle relaxer, causes sleepiness.</p><p>As i watch, it appears the muscle relaxers dont work . So the pharmacist must have deluted those, too. So will Ava investigate what is wrong with the muscle relaxers, that will also point to the deluted lithium?</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Candie</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>April 11, 2024, 12:44am <span itemprop=position>19</span></span><p>It was funny because jason was asking sonny if he is taking his meds and then it was ava taking sonnys meds <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/rofl.png title=:rofl: alt=:rofl: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/rofl.png title=:rofl: alt=:rofl: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/rofl.png title=:rofl: alt=:rofl: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>I think today it was proven ava has nothing to do with his meds being tampered with ,she is unaware what valentine is doing . If she comes clean to sonny and lets him know , she took some of his pills to help her sleep but they didnt do anything for , maybe sonny will discover something is not right with his meds.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Candie</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>April 11, 2024, 12:45am <span itemprop=position>20</span></span><p>she’s in love with sonny <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/heart_eyes.png title=:heart_eyes: alt=:heart_eyes: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/joy.png title=:joy: alt=:joy: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmpp2jqK6osYybppqqlKh8tXvDoptmmaaWerWtyp5kqKaVYrynedKopaexo2SFc4GYa2w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
