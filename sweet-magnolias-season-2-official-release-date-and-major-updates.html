Although less attention was paid to the drama than other titles, in the United States in a short time it climbed the Top Ten, finishing in first place. This figure certainly bodes well for the renewal, which Netflix then made official towards the end of July 2020.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Sweet Magnolias Season 2: What Is The Plot?</strong></h2><p>There’s no shortage of material for a second season, and if you want more, the show is based on Sherryl Woods’ The Sweet Magnolias series of novels. The first season partially merged three books, Stealing Home, A Slice of Heaven and Feels Like Family, so as to immediately introduce the three friends. In fact, in the works of the writer, in the beginning, we know Maddie, Dana Sue and Helen separately, with a novel dedicated to each of them.</p><p>Moving on to the plot of Sweet Magnolias Season 2, we should know Kyle’s condition after the accident and who Ty, Annie or their schoolmates were sitting with the boy in the car. Another issue that will be resumed is the relationship between Maddie and Cal, in dire straits at the end of the first season. Obviously, then, the plot will further explore the stories of Dana Sue, with the return of her ex-husband, and of Helen, ever closer to Erik. Finally, remember that Isaac has not yet discovered who his real parents are.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ascdh3im55vh3yir_1590042696-1024x768.jpeg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Sweet Magnolias Season 2: Netflix Release Date?</strong></h2><p>At this point, you will surely be curious to know when the new chapter comes out. Netflix has announced that the release date for season 2 of Sweet Magnolias will fall on February 4, 2022. Filming in Georgia wrapped in early August, as a result, we knew we could see Maddie, Dana Sue and Helen on our screens in early 2022.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Sweet Magnolias Season 2: Who’s In The Cast?</strong></h2><p>In the cast of Sweet Magnolias Season 2, we will see JoAnna Garcia Swisher, Brooke Elliott and Heather Headley, as the three protagonists Maddie Townsend, Dana Sue Sullivan and Helen Decatur. At their side the following actors should then reappear with their respective characters :</p><ul><li>Justin Bruening as Cal Maddox</li><li>Logan Allen as Kyle Townsend</li><li>Anneliese Judge as Annie Sullivan</li><li>Carson Rowland as Tyler “Ty” Townsend</li><li>Chris Klein as Bill Townsend</li><li>Dion Johnstone as Erik Whitley</li><li>Chris Medlin as Isaac Downey</li><li>Hunter Burke as Trotter Vidhyarkorn</li><li>Al-Jaleel Knox as Gabe Weatherspoon</li><li>Harlan Drum as CeCe Matney</li><li>Sam Ashby as Jackson Lewis</li><li>Bianca Berry Tarantino as Katie Townsend</li></ul><p>In season 2 of Sweet Magnolias, we shouldn’t see Noreen Fitzgibbons, played by Jamie Lynn Spears. Towards the end of the first chapter, in fact, the young woman leaves Bill and Serenity. Instead, we have included the same Kyle, Annie and Ty since, although we do not yet know their fate, we believe they will still be present.</p><p>The TV series is a Daniel L. Paulson Productions and Netflix production, with Sherryl Woods, Sheryl J. Anderson, also showrunners, Dan Paulson and Norman Buckley serving as executive producers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sweet-magnolias-season-2-netflix-screenshot-4.jpeg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Sweet Magnolias Season 2: Names & Number Of Episodes</strong></h2><p>After the first season of 10 episodes, each lasting about 50 minutes, we assume a new chapter of the same length. The first titles have already been released.
