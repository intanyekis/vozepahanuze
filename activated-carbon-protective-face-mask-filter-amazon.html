Protective face masks were just never part of our daily routine, unless perhaps we were medical workers or construction workers. Everything is different now, and masks are suddenly a must. But what if you don’t own any?</p><p>Using a bandana or an old shirt can be helpful, especially if you know how to sew — but really, you’re going to want something that really seals off your nose and mouth areas when you’re around other people, as per the CDC’s recommendations. That’s why <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this mask is going to be our go-to</a> — especially with its filtering capabilities!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PM2.5 Activated Carbon Filter Mask</a> for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$9</a> at Amazon with free shipping! Get it as early as May 1, 2020! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, April 10, 2020, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p>It’s clear even visually that this mask is heavy-duty when it comes to air filtration. You’ll immediately notice the respiratory valve on the outside. Know how things get super humid super fast when you cover up your nose and mouth? This valve may help prevent that heat and moisture buildup, along with preventing CO2 accumulation. Things only get more impressive from there.</p><p>Beneath the soft cotton layer on the outside is a space to slip in activated carbon filters. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This mask</a> comes with two, by the way! These filters may help protect you from breathing in dust, pollen, smoke, vehicle exhaust, hazy air and more. While any unused medical-grade or N-95 masks we own should be donated to healthcare workers coming into direct contact with sick patients, this multi-benefit mask may still help slow the spread — especially among those who are asymptomatic!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PM2.5 Activated Carbon Filter Mask</a> for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$9</a> at Amazon with free shipping!

This element of customized comfort goes a long way here, especially when you’re out for an extended period of time. Just make sure when you’re back not to touch your face with unclean hands while removing it!</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This mask</a> is available in multiple colors that anyone can wear, as well as kids sizes for anyone aged two or older.
