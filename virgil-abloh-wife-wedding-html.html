But the problem with waiting so long was that Sundberg would be vigilant. She would be expecting. Hence, he had to be especially careful about how he would do it.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>As usual, Abloh asked his then-girlfriend to drop him off at the airport for a work-related trip. Without letting the ruse down, he said his goodbyes, and just like that, Sundberg stepped off the passenger seat of the car to come around to the driver's side.&nbsp;</p><p>By the time she got there, he was already on one knee, ring in hand.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>“I was completely surprised – I couldn’t believe it!” <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">recalled Sundberg to Inside Weddings</a>, years later. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Planning for the Big Day</h2><p>As one might expect, Sundberg was really excited to begin preparing for the wedding. After all, their decade-long relationship was soon to arrive at a new milestone.</p><p>While Abloh shared the same excitement, he admitted to the outlet that he let his wife do most of the planning. He said,&nbsp;</p><p>I played more of a supportive role, helping to filter ideas and decide between options.</p><p>From the venue to the decor, Sundberg made it a point to make their big day distinctively unique. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She also added that she wanted to include interesting design details and fashionable elements to enhance the look and feel of the ceremony.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Day of the Wedding</h2><p>For the venue, the bride settled on a luxurious hotel where she felt the most comfortable.&nbsp;She leaned into her favorite shade of purple as the basis of the color scheme.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Following suit, she decided that pink tones would complement her spectacular pale pink Amsale gown.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The ambiance of the venue was put together by hundreds of candles placed at varying heights alongside the seating arrangements.&nbsp;Dramatic lights accentuated the purple hues.</p><p>Deep purple carpeting over the slightly curved aisle featured a custom-lit monogram, that took center stage. Bridesmaids were dressed in&nbsp;floor-length aubergine gowns.</p><p>They carried small nosegays of fuchsia roses, while the bride held a bouquet of maroon calla lilies encircled by roses that offset her blush gown and vibrant purple pumps.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The couple exchanged&nbsp;separately written vows&nbsp;which happened to end up&nbsp;incredibly similar.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The table arrangements during the reception were such that the couple could go around to different tables and surprise them.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Apparently, their consultant had set up two extra table settings at particular tables so that the bride and groom could entertain different tables every time a new course arrived.&nbsp;</p><p>Reminiscing their wedding, Abloh&nbsp;fondly remembered his wedding as the most special evening of their lives and expressed that he was thankful to everyone involved.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaK6Zp7SquIyamaWnmGLEqrLEZq6enJSeu6h6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
