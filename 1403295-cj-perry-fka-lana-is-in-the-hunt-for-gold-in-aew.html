Perry spoke about her time in WWE and reminisced about her rivalry against Nia Jax.</p><p>During the same interview, Perry <a href=#>opened up</a> about one of her mentors Paul Heyman. She thanked Heyman for giving her enough time on the microphone to establish her character.</p><p>The former Ravishing Russian also claimed that Heyman is one of the main reasons for Roman Reigns’ current run as the Undisputed Universal Champion.</p><p>“He’s so charismatic, of course. He can talk his ass off, but he’s also a lot of times the brains behind the operation, and he in my opinion is really the huge success behind Roman and his heel turn. He’s a wordsmith. I was about to get my amazing contract for the last two years because Paul Heyman was the showrunner and he put me in this incredible story. Yeah, it was very controversial, it was very, people loved it and hated it. But the numbers didn’t lie, and I’m so thankful for those last two years of that contract that I got. I’m so forever grateful that Paul gave me that opportunity and gave me that time on the mic. So, so grateful for that. I just think that he’s an incredibly creative mind,” Perry said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>CJ Perry has joined her husband in AEW.
