Because of this, it makes sense that actors want to hop on board the Marvel train.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chris Hemsworth has been with Marvel for over a decade, and he has certainly reaped the rewards of his work. Hemsworth has made <a href=#>tens of millions</a> of dollars with Marvel, but some feel that he was underpaid early on.</p><p>Let's take a look at Chris Hemsworth and see if he was underpaid for Thor.</p><h2 id=chris-hemsworth-is-a-great-actor-with-a-huge-resume>Chris Hemsworth Is A Great Actor With A Huge Resume</h2><p>When looking at some of the biggest names working in acting today, it becomes quite clear that Chris Hemsworth is among the funniest and most successful men in all of Hollywood. Sure, his muscles and his penchant for appearing in action flicks might tell one story, but the truth is that his comedic acting is top-notch, and it's a huge reason why he has reached the top of Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hemsworth got his start back in his native Australia before heading stateside for success in Hollywood, and it took a long time for things to get going. Despite contemplating leaving it all behind due to a lack of success, Hemsworth stayed the course and soon found himself landing in successful projects.</p><p>It wasn't easy for the actor, but his patience and his perseverance are paying off in a major way these days. He's one of the most loved actors working in Hollywood, and he will have plenty of opportunities to build his legacy and his wealth in the coming years, something that fans cannot wait to see unfold.</p><p>Of course, things really took off for the actor once he got the chance to star as Thor in the MCU.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything We Know About Tom Hiddleston And Chris Hemsworth's Real Life Relationship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chris-hemsworth-has-thrived-in-the-role-of-39-thor-39>Chris Hemsworth Has Thrived In The Role Of 'Thor'</h2><p>Back in 2011, the MCU was still in the midst of Phase One, and it was introducing the heroes that would guide the franchise through the Infinity Saga. During this era, Chris Hemsworth was introduced as Thor, and bleached eyebrows aside, it was clear that Hemsworth was going to be around for some time.</p><p>It took a while, but eventually, Thor became one of the best parts of the MCU. This is largely thanks to the franchise finally realizing that Hemsworth is one of the funniest actors in all of Hollywood. The switch in Thor's personality helped greatly, and Thor: Ragnarok shifted the public's perception of the character. Since then, Thor has become a beloved part of pop culture, and Hemsworth has benefitted greatly because of it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's been a blast getting to watch Chris Hemsworth play Thor on the big screen in the MCU, and it's common knowledge that he is rolling in the dough these days. However, back when he was first cast as the God of Thunder, Hemsworth wasn't making the type of money that one would expect for a superhero film.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Chris Hemsworth Confessed That He Made This Mistake While Playing Thor</a></span></p><h2 id=chris-hemsworth-didn-39-t-make-much-at-first-playing-thor-for-the-mcu>Chris Hemsworth Didn't Make Much At First Playing Thor For The MCU</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CheatSheet</a>, Hemsworth only took home $150,000 for his time in Thor, which was his first entry in the MCU. For a starring role in a big-budget superhero flick, that's not a whole lot of money, but it's important to note that he was a relative unknown at the time, and that the MCU itself was still going through growing pains.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thankfully, Thor was a hit at the box office, and eventually, Hemsworth would have the chance to play the character in a number of other MCU films, eventually making him one of the most popular heroes in the the world today. This, in turn, led to the actor getting a substantial bump in pay in both the MCU and other endeavors, as well.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, "2013 alone, Chris Hemsworth earned $58 million thanks to roles in "Rush" and "Thor." Between June 2016 and June 2017, Chris earned $30 million from his various endeavors. Between June 2017 and June 2018, he earned $65 million. Between June 2018 and June 2019, Chris earned $75 million – giving him the rank of 24th on Forbes' list of highest-paid celebrities."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Chris Hemsworth Is Snowed Under This Christmas As He Returns In ‘Extraction 2’</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There aren't many movie stars making this type of money, but then again, there aren't many out there who can do what Hemsworth does while the cameras are rolling.
