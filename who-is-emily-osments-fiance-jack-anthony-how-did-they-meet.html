The ring features a square diamond and a circular emerald set in a gold frame.

The vast majority of what we know about Anthony comes from the Instagram posts that Emily Osment has made public.</p><p>Although Osment and Anthony <a href=#>have kept their relationship under wraps</a>, the actress has given fans a peek into their romance on social media on occasion. Osment called Anthony the "absolute best" in a March birthday message, praising his generosity, humor, and enthusiasm for life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/8.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Osment and Anthony became Instagram official in 2021 when she began posting pictures of them together.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Austin Butler Hookup With Any Of His Hannah Montana Or Zoey 101 Co-Stars?</a></span></p><p>Osment and her new boyfriend traveled to several Italian seaside locations in August of 2021.

A therapist like Gilbert would be in a better position to comment.
