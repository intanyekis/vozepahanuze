Kanye married his current partner, Bianca Censori, in a non-legally binding ceremony shortly after they began dating amid reports he didn’t want to have sex before marriage.</p><p>For Julia, she says it never got to that point in their relationship. She replied, “There, like, wasn't any. It wasn't really about that.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>All The Kardashian Kids In Order From Oldest To Youngest</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=julia-broke-up-with-kanye-because-he-had-ldquo-unresolved-issues-rdquo>Julia Broke Up With Kanye Because He Had “Unresolved Issues”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/kanye-west-is-preparing-to-release-another-album-as-bianca-censori-leads-his-music-and-fashion-comeback.jpg><p>Kanye and Julia’s time together was brief. They reportedly met at a New Year’s Eve party 2021 amid Ye’s divorce from Kim Kardashian but broke up the following February.</p><p>Julia later discussed the reason for their split in a September 2022 interview with Evening Standard, where she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed the Yeezy designer had a lot of “unresolved issues”</a> for which she didn’t have the “bandwidth” to deal with.</p><p>"The unresolved issues that he was dealing with. It just seems like he had a lot to work on, and I just don't have time for it, or energy," the Uncut Gems star elaborated. "I don't have the bandwidth or emotional capacity for it.

Julia expressed her belief that industry professionals were not taking her seriously because of her connection to Ye and his controversial reputation (which included a slew of antisemitic comments last year).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"After this whole big relationship and all the things that followed, I definitely felt like, oh I feel a shift in like the acting way, not in a good way," Julia explained.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Kardashian-Jenner Family Net Worth Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></span></p><p>"It's like I'm not getting as many offers as I was before, weirdly," she went on, saying she felt as though she was seen as a "liability, just tabloid type of person.”</p><p>More recently, earlier this month, <a href=#>Julia revealed that she won’t be devoting a lot of space</a> to her Kanye relationship in her upcoming memoir, for fear of “bad blood.” "It's like six pages," Julia, 33, explained. "I feel like I went very lightly on it. I'm not trying to have bad blood or anything, it's all in the past."</p><p>Bianca is likely grateful to no longer be associating with Kanye now, given that he’s causing a wave of legal controversy abroad in Italy with his partner, Bianca, <a href=#>which has even launched a police investigation</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihrqSZlnqnu9dmm56elaOxtHnRnqOarJmku7S0yKlkpJmerrJuw8Ssq2asmKTCqLSMoqtmqqWeu6awjKucqa2klsGqu81o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
