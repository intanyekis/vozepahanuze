"They're your friends, the ones that you speak to on a daily basis,” the SKIMS founder said. “But you take it all out on me. And I'm trying the best that I can."</p><p>This prompted Kourtney to call her younger sister selfish. "It's about you. You are a narcissist," she clapped back.

"We have side chats about everybody. That's just what you do,” Kim said.</p><p>Kim and Kourtney have been feuding last year after Kim landed a partnership with Dolce & Gabana after they dressed Kourtney and Travis for their Italian wedding.
