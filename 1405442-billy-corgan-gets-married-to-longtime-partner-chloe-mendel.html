In an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">interview</a> with WrestleZone&nbsp;Managing Editor Bill Pritchard, the Smashing Pumpkins frontman explained his vision for the legendary promotion as well as his go-to for measuring success.</p><p>“It’s important to evaluate anybody in the entertainment world with, what are they actually trying to accomplish? The NWA is an international promotion that’s trying to set up another run of success. That involves international television licensing deals, merchandise deals, toys. So, every decision I’m trying to make at the local level, a show in Saint Louis, a show — hopefully we haven’t announced it yet, coming up pretty soon somewhere else in America.</p><p>“I have to balance, ‘Okay. We got to sell tickets to Saint Louis. We got to sell tickets in Nashville at the TV tapings. At the same time, I’m trying to figure out, am I going to have a product that’s going to work in Japan, Mexico, Canada, Abu Dhabi?’ It’s hard at the level that we’re at for people to understand that that’s my calculus. My calculus is success, it’s international. It’s, ‘Can we compete at the highest levels of the wrestling business?’</p><p>“I have more money than Paul Heyman ever did. And I don’t mean that as a slight. Paul to me is a genius. But I’m saying is if all I did was blow money and run 12 events a year, and put on really, really good strong shows and hire the best available independent talent, I think the NWA name would be a little hotter in the mouths of the marks. But it wouldn’t take me one inch closer to the deal that I’m after, which is big licensing deals. And again, I don’t mean this as a slight. I wasn’t able to buy my way up towards the top of the line. I wasn’t able to sit with the major network and say, ‘I can bring all this money to the table like WWE can or Tony [Khan] can,” Corgan said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNpbG1sYmKvqrjLsmScp6Kcrq95xp6rrGWdlr%2BztcSdZK2nXaG8r7PToqSeZaCWv7W6xKtknKCcpLJuucSnm56k</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
