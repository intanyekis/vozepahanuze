Six months after joining the talk show, <strong>Amanda Seales</strong> announced that she will not return, via an Instagram Live on Tuesday, June 2.</p><p>“My contract is up at The Real, and I didn’t renew it,” Seales, 38, said. “It doesn’t feel good to my soul to be at a place where I cannot speak to my people the way they need to be spoken to, and where the people that are speaking to me in despairing ways are not being handled.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Amanda-Seales-Exit-The-Real-After-6-Months-001.jpg><p>The Insecure star continued: “I’m not at a space where, as a full black woman, I can have my voice and my co-workers also have their voices, and where the people at the top are not respecting the necessity for black voices to be at the top, too.”</p><p>Seales joined the show as a cohost in January, taking the fifth seat at the roundtable next to <strong>Loni Love</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Jeannie Mai</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Tamera Mowry</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Adrienne Bailon</strong></a>.</p><p>On Wednesday, June 3, Seales responded to claims that she was leaving the show due to a disagreement with her cohosts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Amanda-Seales-Exit-The-Real-After-6-Months-002.jpg><p>“Do not try to create some false dissention between me and the cohosts of The Real. Y’all so f—ing corny. There is a whole pandemic and an uprising going on, and you still can’t find s— else to do but try and create some kind of conflict that doesn’t exist? I did not unfollow Loni Love. I haven’t unfollowed anybody,” the comedian said via an Instagram story. “What ya’ll don’t understand is grown women do grown women business. That’s what y’all don’t understand, and what I gotta do with my business ain’t got nothing to do with them sisters.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Warner Bros. confirmed to Us Weekly that Seales has decided to exit the show. A source also tells Us that she was offered to extend her contract, but she declined.</p><p>Her decision to exit comes amid the global protests against police brutality <a href=#>after the May 25 murder of <strong>George Floyd</strong></a>. The unarmed black man died in Minneapolis after police officer <strong>Derek Chauvin</strong> pressed a knee neck for nearly nine minutes. Chauvin has since been fired and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter.</p><p>For more information, visit <a href=#>blacklivesmatter.com</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJimmZ6Zrm6%2FxJqjnqtdqbxusdeiq2asmJp6s7HApWSsmamoeqO4wJyiZq6fnrCmv4ynpq1lmJqus7CO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
