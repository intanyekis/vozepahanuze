Furness, called for the “immediate transition of Scout Sniper Platoons to Scout Platoons” meaning that infantry battalions will no longer have sniper attachments, but instead scouts who will “provide the commander with relevant, reliable, accurate and prompt information.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Scout Snipers provide cover and observation during a boarding and seizure operation to retake the ship Magellan Star from suspected pirates on Sept. 9, 2010 in the Gulf of Aden. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Marine Corps officials believe that the “newly designed Infantry companies were insufficient to offer the Battalion continuous all-weather information gathering,” and that the new Scout Platoons will be better utilized by leadership throughout the branch, according to the memo.</p><p>Instead of completely moving away from sniping, a new MOS “Reconnaissance Sniper” will be established “within the Reconnaissance Battalions.”&nbsp;</p><p>The new Scout Platoons will consist of 26 Marines, a first lieutenant, and an infantry gunnery sergeant, which will be larger than the traditional Scout Sniper Platoons that are comprised of 18 Marines.</p><p>Scout Snipers are highly trained, precise marksmen, who provide support for ground combat operations and gather important intelligence for commands across the Marine Corps.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">A United States Marine scout sniper and his spotter keep watch above a gate at the industrial park on March 12, 2004, in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Starting in the fiscal year of 2024, there will be “zero allocated seats” for the “Scout Sniper Basic Course.”&nbsp;</p><p>“The shift to a Scout Platoon will allow those Marines to focus their training and evaluations on scouting, providing commanders the right tools to accomplish their mission,” Marine spokesman Capt. Ryan Bruce told the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marine Corps Times</a>.</p><p>The memo also stated that designated marksmen — Marines that receive additional marksmanship training but are not snipers — will still remain within infantry companies, along with precision rifles.</p><p>The transition away from sniping was called out by the USMC Scout Sniper Association, which blamed “senior leadership” within the Corps for not giving the Scout Sniper Platoons the resources to meet the Marine Corps needs.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">A Marine with Scout Sniper with 2nd Battalion, 6th Marines, adjusts the scope of an M40 bolt-action sniper rifle during a weapon zeroing at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, on Sept. 3, 2015. <span class=credit>Cpl.

You have representatives in Congress who want to hear from you.”</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">critically acclaimed </a>biographical film “Jarhead,” based on the best-selling 2003 novel of the same name, starring Jake Gyllenhaal as Anthony Swofford — a Marine Scout Sniper — follows Swofford’s experience as a sniper during the Gulf War.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2xmaWxfoq6ztc2eZJynoqXAbr%2FHrqutoZ6ceqW71qdkoqyjYrKttdOeZKybn6rBbr%2FNoqeeql2lv7Cz0ZqkaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
