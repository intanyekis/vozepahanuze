"It's official . . . I'm White!!!" he wrote in a caption for the photo, in white the African-American entertainer is transformed into a Caucasian man named "Connor Smallnut" wearing a flannel, t-shirt, jeans and a hipster beanie.</p><p>Continued the hashtag-heavy entry: "#WHITEPEOPLEPARTYMUSIC #Wppm in stores April 1st!!!!!!Dude Go Get It!!!Join The Party!!!! #GoodCredit #DogKissing #BeerPong #FarmersMarkets #FistPumping #CreamCheeseEating #RacialDraft 'Bro I got drafted!!'"</p><p>Hours before posting that photo, <a href=#><strong>Mariah Carey'</strong></a>s husband spoke with <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a>'s Entertainment Director <strong>Ian Drew </strong>about the provocatively-titled new album. "You go to a party and white people are having more fun than anybody," Cannon told <strong>Us</strong>. "They know how to have a good time! I could have named the album Purple People Party Music and you'd still get the same album, but it was just one of those things. You know, you deal with things like race, and people get uptight, so why not?"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The father to twins Moroccan and Monroe explained the specific genesis of that LP name. "As a DJ, you name all your different playlists and your crates that you keep your music in. I had all these crates, and thought about mixing them from Dirty South to Midwest — and one crate is called White People Party Music," he said. "It's hilarious — when I came up with that title, I thought I have to name my album that. I just kind of stuck with it from there."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKWim5tisKK6zailZquYlr%2Bmv4ywn6KslZuupLGMqZ%2BorJ9iwbB5z6umpqekmnq4tMitnGaolaS9rbGMqZirrKliura%2FyJxkmqSSqrpusdepo5qhnqh6tbXTpZxmamBmgXOBkmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
