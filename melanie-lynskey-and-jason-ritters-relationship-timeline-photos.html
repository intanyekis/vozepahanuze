Lynskey <a href=#>confirmed her daughter’s arrival later that month</a>, revealing that the little one was born in December 2018.</p><p>“We feel lucky to have been able to have our news just be for friends and family for a while, but I guess the story got out, so! Yes!” the <a href=#>Two and a Half Men</a> alum tweeted in January 2019. “We love her so much; she’s perfect.”</p><p>She went on to jokingly clarify a few details that were circulating, writing, “I would like to correct a couple of things that have been stated in articles online: 1) Jason was NOT in <a href=#>Boy Meets World </a>and wow that would have been pretty easy to check. 2) I did NOT welcome the baby ‘quietly,’ I was blasting <a href=#><strong>A$AP Rocky</strong></a> and yelling a lot.”</p><p>Since welcoming their baby girl, the couple have continued to keep their relationship and home life somewhat private. They have, however, poked fun at each other on social media from time to time.</p><p>In October 2021, <a href=#>Lynskey trolled her man</a> after he promoted multiple auction items for a Huntington’s Disease Society of America fundraiser but failed to mention a prize that featured a hangout with the <a href=#>Sweet Home Alabama</a> actress.</p><p>“VERY SURPRISED that Jason chose to focus on the fact that you can bid on amazing original artwork by @_AlexHirsch @DanaTerrace & more, and NOT on the fact that you could win a zoom with me, but that’s ok, Jason,” Lynskey joked via Twitter. “Get a zoom with me OR amazing original artwork, you decide.”</p><p>Ritter quickly <a href=#>responded to his partner</a>, writing, “Hahaha!! I did a TikTok Live where I was very explicit about what a huge deal it is for a generally introverted person to donate a zoom!”</p><p>The <a href=#>California native</a> made it clear that he appreciated Lynskey, adding, “I love you so much, and thank you for looking after our daughter the whole time I’m doing this event tonight!!🥰😍.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Candy star</a> replied, “You are so cute. Somehow I missed that TikTok,” to which Ritter joked, “One day you’ll follow me on TikTok.” Lynskey wrapped things up by tweeting, “And I love you too.”</p><p>Three months later, <a href=#>Ritter again showed Lynskey love via Twitter</a>, this time in honor of her interview with Rolling Stone where she opened up about sexism in Hollywood and her hit Showtime series, Yellowjackets.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I love this incredible person,” he simply wrote in January 2022 while resharing the article.</p><p>Scroll down to relive Ritter and Lynskey’s sweetest relationship moments:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuqa4wKegnmWcrru0t8SyZJqmlGK3or%2FOp2SroaSpsrO%2FjKucpZmknryvv8eip2asmaKyrbXNnmSpoJ%2BpvLR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
