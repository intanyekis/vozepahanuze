He is considered one of the best golfers in history, having won nine major championships on the regular tour and nine on the Champions Tour.</p><p>Player started young, winning the 1965 US Open at the age of 29 and completing the career Grand Slam before turning 30, becoming the youngest player to accomplish this feat at the time. He won over 150 professional tournaments and was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1974.</p><p>Player is known by various nicknames, including “The Black Knight,” “Mr. Fitness,” and the “International Ambassador of Golf.” He established Gary Player Design, a renowned golf course design firm, and has written many books on golf, philosophy, fitness, and other topics.</p><p>Player is also an active philanthropist, having raised millions of dollars for various charities over the years. In 2021, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Donald Trump.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Golf_Career>Early Life and Golf Career</span></h2><p>Gary Player was born on November 1st, 1935 in Johannesburg, South Africa. He grew up with two elder siblings and lost his mother to cancer at the age of eight. His father supported his passion for golf and took out a loan to buy him his first set of golf clubs. Player practiced his golf technique at Virginia Park golf course and played his first real rounds of golf at the age of 14. He turned professional at 17 years old, and by 16, he believed he would one day become the world’s greatest player.</p><p>Player’s older brother, Ian, went on to become a renowned educator and conservationist, helping save the white rhino from extinction.</p><h2><span id=Gary_Players_Golf_Career>Gary Player’s Golf Career</span></h2><p>Gary Player was one of the “Big Three” golfers who dominated the sport in the late 1950s until the late 1970s, competing with Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus. He tied for fourth place in terms of major championship victories and was one of only five golfers to complete the career Grand Slam at 29 years old.</p><p>Player became a regular fixture on the PGA Tour in the late 1950s and went on to win 24 career Tour titles, leading the money list in 1961. He was known for his exceptional business, entering an incredible number of tournaments throughout the world in any given year. Player has flown an estimated 16 million miles in air travel, more than any other athlete in history.</p><p>Player won more victories at the South African Open and the Australian Open than any other golfer in history. He also won the British Open in three different decades and his last win at the Masters came in 1978, in which he also won the Tournament of Champions. He later became the oldest golfer to make the cut at the 1998 Masters, which he attributed to his diet and overall fitness.</p><h2><span id=Family_Life_and_Legacy>Family Life and Legacy</span></h2><p>In 1957, Gary Player married Vivienne Verwey, sister of pro golfer Bobby Verwey. The couple had six children and 22 grandchildren, plus two great-grandchildren.

Vivienne died of cancer in 2021.</p><h2><span id=Controversies_Surrounding_Gary_Player>Controversies Surrounding Gary Player</span></h2><p>In 1966, Gary Player made controversial statements supporting apartheid in South Africa, which sparked outrage. He described whites as having civilized values while labeling other occupants as “alien barbarians” who practice “ritual murder and polygamy.” His comments were met with protests and taunts from hecklers. However, by 1987, Player disavowed his statements and called apartheid a “cancerous disease.” He raised millions of dollars for underprivileged youths in South Africa through his charity, The Player Foundation.</p><p>In 1962, Player took the Augusta National green jacket home after losing the Masters Tournament, which caused minor controversy. Only winners are allowed to take their jackets home, and others must keep them on club grounds. After being contacted by the club Chairman, Player defended himself by claiming he wasn’t aware of the rules.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunCzwKuwZqiclsamvoynnK1lp6S%2FtbSO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
