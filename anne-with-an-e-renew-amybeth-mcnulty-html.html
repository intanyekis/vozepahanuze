She will play the role of Vickie,&nbsp;“a hip, fast-talking band nerd who makes one of the heroes fall for her."&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>McNulty&nbsp;previously appeared on&nbsp;Anne with an E, playing the role of protagonist&nbsp;Anne Shirley. The&nbsp;show is a modern&nbsp;adaptation of&nbsp;Lucy Maud Montgomery's 1908 classic children's novel,&nbsp;Anne of Green Gables.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>However, the show&nbsp;was cut short after three seasons following a dispute between the&nbsp;producers,&nbsp;Netflix, and CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation).&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Though Netflix announced the cancellation of the show late&nbsp;in 2019, fans&nbsp;continued pushing for its&nbsp;renewal.</p><p>In early 2020, McNulty was shocked to find illustrations of herself displayed across Times Square and downtown Toronto. Unbeknownst to her, the 19-year-old actress had become the center of a fan campaign that aimed to persuade Netflix to renew <a href=# rel=follow>Anne with an E</a>.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The campaign, which consisted primarily of an online petition, had received more than 1.5 million signatures. This&nbsp;prompted an emotional response from the star. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>, "The fight these people put up is remarkable. I will never forget that. What an experience to be a part of." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She also stated&nbsp;neither she nor the crew saw this coming and that she was grateful for and, even, mind-blown by all the support she had&nbsp;received.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>At the time, McNulty also said it would be her dream to finish the show off with either a mini-series or a movie and that she would "partake in anything to finalize it." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The campaign gained a lot of traction as many A-list celebrities, most notably&nbsp;superstar Ryan Reynolds, also pushed for the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">show's renewal</a>.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>With McNulty now set to feature in another Netflix special, fans believe this is the opportune moment for the production team to patch things up with the star and fans.</p><p>Unfortunately, Netflix has not yet commented on any potential renewal, but fans remain hopeful nonetheless. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>The Major Rift Between Netflix and CBC</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>While both CBC&nbsp;and Netflix initially refrained from giving reasons for the show's cancellation, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">later reports revealed</a> the fractured relationship between the two companies. The CEO and President of CBC, Catherine Tait,&nbsp;likened&nbsp;Netflix's presence in Canada to "imperialism." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>She drew an analogy of Netflix being the Viceroy of India and blindly believing it was doing good for the Indian people. She urged the company to be mindful of its impact on local Canadians and how they respond to global companies coming into their country.&nbsp;</p><p>Stéphane Cardin, Netflix's director of public policy for Canada, responded, "We're not here to chase a low dollar." He also emphasized that Netflix's primary aim was to provide opportunities for Canadians to broadcast shows to the world "like they never could before."</p><p>Tait, in turn, remained hesitant about making long-term deals with Netflix, as she felt it would feed the growth of foreign companies more than that of the domestic industries.&nbsp;</p><p>This dispute has led to a rocky and seemingly irreconcilable relationship. While crew and cast members and fans all remain hopeful for a series renewal, there is little evidence to suggest a real possibility of this happening.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJmeo7Juw8itn2aZnmKybr7Ep5ywZZGixqOx06Fkppueqrm1xY2hq6ak</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
