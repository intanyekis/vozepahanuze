They went on to date for three years.</p><p class=p1><a href=#>Following their split</a>, Hill romanced the likes of <a href=#><strong>Rita Ora</strong></a>, <strong>Alana Haim</strong> and <a href=#>former fiancée <strong>Gianna Santos</strong></a> before confirming his relationship with surfer <strong>Sarah Brady</strong> via Instagram in October 2021.</p><p class=p1>Hill and Brady made their <a href=#>red carpet debut</a> at the premiere of Don’t Look Up in December 2021. Two months later, he shut down engagement rumors in a since-deleted Instagram post. “The rumors are true,” he wrote, before joking, “I’m engaged. But not to my girlfriend. I am engaged to your mom. I know this is shocking but please respect our privacy at this time.”</p><p>It is unknown exactly when the couple called it quits, but Hill was spotted with girlfriend <strong>Olivia Millar</strong> for the first time in August 2022.</p><p>Regardless of his romantic status, Hill has previously asserted that <a href=#>his main goal in life is to be content and fulfilled</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“So when you ask me what I do, I’m like, work s—t comes easy to me,” the&nbsp;<i>22 Jump Street&nbsp;</i>actor <a href=#>told&nbsp;<i>GQ Style&nbsp;</i>in August 2021.</a> “… I want to be happy. I literally want to be happy. That is the mission of my life, that I work hard at.”</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to see Hill’s past flings and romances through the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkt7C6wKFkoaGcocBusMCtoKefXZ22tMDOq7BmrJinvLazx2aroZ1drrKivtJmp6GnpKTAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
