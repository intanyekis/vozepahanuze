You&nbsp;can buy groceries from half way across the world, schedule birthday messages on social networks, and even set the coffee maker to prepare a fresh brew when you walk through the door. But for all the benefits, there is a darker side to the World Wide Web.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>No doubt you’ve already prepared your system to combat hackers with the latest firewalls and antivirus software, but what about dangers from the other side? EVP is no longer the only digital outlet for ghosts to conduct their hauntings. Now they have access to a medium far larger, with a vaster network, and there’s nothing we can do to stop them. With all the technological advancements of the modern age, perhaps in the near future paranormal beings may not need to channel communication through mediums and psychics at all; social networks for the dead could be just around the corner.&nbsp;From possessed hardware to phantom emails, the following 12 websites and technologies suggest that the Internet is no longer purely of the digital realm.</p><h2 id=12-4chan-org><strong>12. 4Chan.org</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2008, 4Chan users attacked a girl named Katy Robinson, after she uploaded a photo of herself onto the site. A day later, a girl claiming to be her sister said that Katy has killed herself as a result of the cyber bullying. Soon after, a figure named Jeff the Killer, with a creepy smile, pale face and dead-looking eyes, began popping up on the boards. This “character” became an Internet sensation, cropping up in video games, short films, comic books and various other media. Soon after 4Chan users realized that Jeff the Killer bore a remarkably similar appearance to the allegedly deceased Katy.</p><p></p><h2 id=11-cthulhu-net><strong>11. Cthulhu.net</strong></h2><p>The now defunct Cthulhu.net is perhaps the most mysterious website on the Internet. For years people struggled to uncover the meaning behind this password protected single page that contained nothing but the words “Dead but dreaming…” on a black background. Even more bizarre is the fact that the Feds got involved. Upon further investigation the site was traced back to someone named Ling, who happened to own a string of other, equally strange websites which were storing terabytes of inaccessible data. Who is Ling? This question is still hotly debated on the Internet. Some people believe this ghostly figure isn’t a person at all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=10-diedinhouse-com><strong>10. DiedInHouse.com</strong></h2><p>Every house has a secret, but it can be harder to fetch top dollar when there’s been a grisly death involved. Realtors are fraught with a tough sell, while buyers struggle to balance finances with morality. Died In House has one purpose; to tell you if someone died in your home. Despite being shunned by the real estate community, CEO and founder Ron Condrey, offers a legitimate service to the public. Who wouldn’t want to know if their house has been the spot of a horrific crime or suicide before they move in? Especially since realtors don’t have to disclose such events to buyers in certain states.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-youtube-com><strong>9. YouTube.com</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2014, a mysterious YouTube account called Webdriver Torso, uploaded more than 74,000 videos throughout a nine month period. Each video contains nothing other than blue and red rectangular shapes and the sound of electronic frequencies. The only video that differed was a ten second clip that flashed an image of the Eiffel Tower, along with the message “Matei is highly intelligent.” For a time nobody knew who started the account; however, it was later revealed to be the work of Google – although its purpose still remains a mystery. Some believe that it’s an EVP experiment, used to communicate with ghosts through white noise.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-ghoststudy-com><strong>8. GhostStudy.com</strong></h2><p>If you fancy giving ghost hunting a try, but would rather bypass the long, cold night in a creepy abandoned manor house, ghost cams are the perfect alternative. All you need to do is load up the feed, sit back, and watch the screen. While the website itself is no longer in use, Ghost Study has links to some of the most popular haunted places in the world, such as the Catacombs of Paris, Ordsall Hall and Gettysburg. Some users have even claimed to have caught a glimpse of the late-great <a href=#>Elvis Presley</a> on the Graceland surveillance cameras.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-deathtimer-com><strong>7. DeathTimer.com</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“When will I die?” It’s a question that haunts us all. Death Timer compiles average statistics from the CIA, United Nations and various medical sources in order to predict your lifespan and give you an exact date of demise. After inputting your BMI and answering a series of lifestyle questions, it will present you with your very own gravestone, informing you how – apparently I’m going to pick a fight with Chuck Norris – and when you will die. Tick the wrong boxes, and you could be in for quite a shock – mine was 6th May 2042; 20 years earlier than I hoped!</p><p></p><h2 id=6-deadmansswitch-net><strong>6. DeadMansSwitch.net</strong></h2><p>Of all the forms of digital communication, you’d think that ghosts would utilize email rather than crackly radios and white noise from the television. Well, that’s finally starting to happen. According to a BBC News broadcast, a man named Tim Hart received a mysterious email from his deceased cousin, Jack Froese that mentioned highly personal information that only the two of them could’ve known. Apart from another close friend hacking Froese’s account – which Hart is convinced isn’t the case –the only other plausible answer is Dead Man’s Switch. This website will automatically send emails to selected friends after a certain period of inactivity, allowing people to leave messages for friends and family in the event of an expected tragedy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=5-joy-of-satan><strong>5. Joy of Satan</strong></h2><p>There’s a lot of stigma centered around Satanism, but not all satanic rites and celebrations revolve around human and animal sacrifice. Joy of Satan is a cheap-looking website dedicated to debunking the myths and exposing the (less sinister) truth about the religion. However, they do have a creepy side, aptly reflected in their homepage statement, “We work directly with Satan.” Past users recruited through the site have reported engaging in online sermons with the purpose of interacting with demons, or as Joy of Satan&nbsp;states, “The Gods of Hell.” Regardless of whether true Satanists are a life loving bunch who believe in rational scientific explanations for all-things-paranormal, summoning beings from Hell just doesn’t seem okay.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-the-marianas-web><strong>4. The Marianas Web</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Also known as The Dark Side of the Internet, the Marianas Web is the deepest, darkest and most mysterious part of the Internet. It’s a place where the worst of humanity gather to engage in the most explicit and illegal activities. In fact, it’s so hidden and remote that some people claim its existence to be mere conjecture. It’s said that to find the Marianas Web you need a quantum computer – something that one cannot simply buy from a tech&nbsp;store. If it does exist, nobody knows how it was created or where it began; although many believe that its true purpose is to serve as a portal for ghostly entities wanting to&nbsp;cross into the digital world.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-scientificpsychic-com><strong>3. ScientificPsychic.com</strong></h2><p>Divination is an ancient practice used to contact spirits of the dead. Occultists believe that the deceased&nbsp;can foresee the future and provide guidance to the living. Ouija boards are the most common gateway of communication. Scientific Psychic has a digital offering for those who’d rather welcome the dead into their computers, rather than the physical realm. When asked “Who are you?” the system responds with “I am the psychic spirit of a dead TRS-80 computer.” With such advancements in technology over the past ten years, it’s hardly surprising that computers are now taking on a life – and afterlife – of their own.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=2-the-galactic-internet><strong>2. The Galactic Internet</strong></h2><p>via:sharetu.com</p><p>In a report published in the Acta Astronautical Journal, chairman of SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Claudio Maccone, suggests that aliens from far away galaxies probably have their own galactic Internet. Unfortunately, his theories have yet to be proven (or discredited), and probably never will,&nbsp;as&nbsp;the signals from the Reptilian equivalent of Facebook would be too weak, making them difficult to hear. Either way, the idea of using an instant messenger as the first line of communication between humans and aliens is still probably more likely than landing on an inhabited planet.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-your-own-computer><strong>1. Your Own Computer</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In Reverend Jim Peasboro’s book, The Devil in the Machine, the Savannah clergyman states that “Any PC built after 1985 has the storage capacity to house an evil spirit.” He even claims that his home computer once fired up and started mocking him through a word processor before printing out pages and pages of text, written in an ancient 2,800 year old Mesopotamian language. Peasboro estimates that roughly one in 10 computers in the United States are possessed by an evil spirit. However, rather than a formal exorcism, he simply suggests replacing the hard drive and reinstalling any lost software.</p><p><strong>References:</strong><a href=#>BBC News</a>, <a href=#>Webdriver Torso</a>, <a href=#>USA Today</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZmpqXaSzbsDHnmSmp6Opeqmt1KernpxdrLKjv8itnKxln6N6tbTEZqCnrJWnu6bAjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
