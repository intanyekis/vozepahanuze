Still a teenager at the time, he made it far in the competition, finishing in second place behind <a href=#><strong>David Cook</strong></a>.</p><p>Despite not winning the season, Archuleta and his former costar remained close. In fact, the “Crush” crooner shared a <a href=#>TikTok video</a> in July that showed him holding an American Idol card with <a href=#>Cook on it listed as the “Season 7 Winner.”</a></p><p>“Check out my new trading card,” Archuleta wrote at the time. The clip then panned to Cook walking toward him, wearing golf gear.</p><p>“I just bought this on eBay and look who I run into?” the Florida native captioned the video on Instagram. “What are the odds???”</p><p>Years after his <a href=#>American Idol experience</a>, Archuleta is still putting out new music, including his new single, “Movin.” He also has pursued other ventures, with his debut children’s book set to be released in October.</p><p>Amid his busy professional life, the former reality star got personal in June, <a href=#>opening up about struggling with his sexuality as a Mormon</a>.</p><p>“I’ve been open to myself and my close family for some years now that I am not sure about my own sexuality,” he revealed via Instagram at the time. “I came out in 2014 as gay to my family. But then I had similar feelings for both genders so maybe a spectrum of bisexual. Then I also have learned I don’t have too much sexual desires and urges as most people which works, I guess, because I have a commitment to save myself until marriage. Which people call asexual when they don’t experience sexual urges.”</p><p>Archuleta then encouraged fellow Christians to be more accepting. “Idk what to make of it and I don’t have all the answers. I just invite you to please consider making room to be more understanding and compassionate to those who are LGBTQIA+, and those who are a part of that community and trying to find that balance with their faith which also is a huge part of their identity like myself,” he noted. “I think we can do better as people of faith and Christians, including Latter-day Saints, to listen more to the wrestle between being LGBTQIA+ and a person of faith.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Cook supported his friend, commenting: “Love you man, and so proud of who you are.”</p><p>Want to see Archuleta’s day in action?
