Unlike Jay Electronica’s followers, Little Brother’s fanbase have never even felt the uncontrollable excitement for the possibility of a new album. Last year, 9th Wonder drove another stake into their hearts when he murdered their dreams of a reunion with one infamous tweet. Now, six years after the release of their final album LeftBack, Little Brother is finally allowing their fans to see a few rays of light with talk of a rare reunion.</p><p>Earlier this week, Phonte Coleman appeared on the latest episode of “The <a href=# id=auto-tag_combat-jack-show_1 data-tag=combat-jack-show>Combat Jack Show</a>” to rap about life as a writer on VH1’s “The Breaks” and Adult Swim’s “Black Dynamite” — and his recent collaboration with Eric Robinson called Tigallerro. The other half of Foreign Exchange also spoke about his current relationship with his former Little Brother cohorts, and explained why he may consider a reunion in the near future.</p><p><strong><a href=#>READ: 9th Wonder Talks Phonte, Jay Z And More On ‘Juan Epstein’</a></strong></p><p>“For a while, I was very reluctant for it, but this past year put it into perspective,” Coleman said in response to a reunion. Within the last year, the music world mourned A Tribe Called Quest’s Phife Dawg and The Revolution’s front man and music icon Prince. Despite their past issues, Phonte feels like he has to take advantage of reuniting before the opportunity disappears forever.</p><p>“There’s one thing to say that I have the option to not do this,” said Phonte. “I can either take it or leave it,” he said. “It’s another thing when that option no longer exists. So, it definitely made me think a lot about wanting, if nothing else, to just put a period at the end of the sentence, to end it properly.”</p><p>Neither 9th Wonder nor Big Pooh have yet to address Phonte’s thoughts on the subject. However, if they get the gears going soon, they have a golden opportunity to make a stellar comeback for the 15-year anniversary of Little Brother’s debut album The Listening. Until then, fans can continue to dream while catching up on Phonte’s seasoned wordplay on his sophomore solo album No News Is Good News — due out before the end of 2016.</p><p>Listen to Phonte on “The Combat Jack Show” below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6W1sLrTnmScp5yauqK6jKCcratdm66vv4yhpqmdo2LCsXnFqKlmmV2lvLS%2FyJujnmWcnsG1uMRmmaunpJ2ys3nRnqynoZ%2BjenWBk2tramc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
