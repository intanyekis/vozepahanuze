In October 2014, she made her first runway debut for Topshop and French fashion designer Sonia Rykiel. After making a breakthrough in her modeling career, Hailey went on to land appearances in several high-profile publications, including Vogue (2015) and Teen Vogue, as well as shooting for fashion brands such as Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Jimmy Choo, and Tiffany. She has also appeared in a handful of other popular publications. However, the young American-born model has since made an even bigger name for herself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After getting married to Justin Bieber, Hailey Bieber has been plunged into the spotlight in a way that she has never experienced before. Marrying such a high-profile celebrity has landed the young American model in front of millions of fresh, young, and impressionable eyes, and in turn, massively increasing her influence.

I found that the most tried-and-true stuff were the solidly formulated products that were affordable, where I could tell people kept on going back to, and that's what I kept going back to as well."</p><p>During the same interview, she went on to additionally explain that 'no decision was made without her,' that she was 'extremely picky,' and that she wants to give people the best amazing products. These sentiments are certainly reflective of her reasoning behind the brand.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While developing the new products, Hailey also managed to stir up a substantial amount of interest in her brand via the social media platform Instagram.
