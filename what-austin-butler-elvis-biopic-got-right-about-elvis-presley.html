He spent months getting into this headspace, studying his life, and reenacting it in the biopic Elvis, alongside Tom Hanks who acted as his manager and the narrator of the story. With every Hollywood biopic, there are bound to be exaggerated or even fully fictional moments thrown into the script to keep audiences entertained. Even so, here are all the big moments Elvis got right about Presley’s life.</p><h2 id=was-elvis-presley-39-s-childhood-accurately-portrayed-in-elvis><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Was Elvis Presley's Childhood Accurately Portrayed In Elvis?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The somewhat tragic story of Elvis Presley’s childhood was accurately portrayed in this biopic. <a href=#>Elvis had a twin brother</a>, named Jesse, who was unfortunately stillborn. As Elvis grew up, his family had to live in the poorer area of town. Because of this, he spent much of his time around gospel and black culture, as his house was in the “black” part of town.</p><h2 id=elvis-presley-39-s-stage-presence-was-truly-unlike-anything-of-that-time><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Elvis Presley's Stage Presence Was Truly Unlike Anything Of That Time</span></h2><p>When Elvis took the stage, it was unlike anything people had ever seen. As a performer, especially a white man, there was a certain expectation of conservative and minimal stage presence. Presley, however, wiggled and shook and moved. This new sight literally sent girls into a screaming frenzy, a response that was otherwise not elicited by singers at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=there-was-a-strong-39-elvis-the-pelvis-39-controversy><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>There Was A Strong 'Elvis The Pelvis' Controversy</span></h2><p>After a few years of gaining higher levels of fame and performing several shows, heated controversies arose. Elvis depicted this by showing some news headlines and adding information about people wanting Presley arrested in the script. This was all true; many parents, newscasters, and people of power during the 50s did not like his provocative performances and wanted to find a way to put an end to it.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Was Elvis Presley Actually Cursed?

Beginning his Hollywood career in 1956, he made over 30 movies over the course of thirteen years. Many of them were musical comedies, as those had the best audience response, but he also starred in films with drama, crime, and western themes.</p><h2 id=elvis-presley-was-drafted-into-the-war-for-2-years><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Elvis Presley Was Drafted Into The War For 2 Years</span></h2><p>Between the release of Elvis’ fourth and fifth movies, he was drafted into the war and served for two years. During this time, Presley lost his mother due to an unfortunate and rapid case of hepatitis, leading to heart failure. In a positive turn of events, his service was also what brought him to cross paths with <a href=#>Priscilla, who would later become his wife</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=was-elvis-amp-priscilla-presley-39-s-relationship-accurate-in-elvis><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Was Elvis & Priscilla Presley's Relationship Accurate In Elvis?</span></h2><p>The depiction of <a href=#>Elvis and Priscilla’s relationship</a> in Elvis was pretty accurate as to what actually took place between them. They fell in love while he was on duty and married in 1967. While together, they had a daughter, but as Elvis was pushed more and more by his work schedule, he became distant. He entertained other women after a gradual separation from Priscilla, and they eventually divorced in 1973, though they always cared for each other.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Austin Butler's Voice Permanently Change Because Of His Elvis Accent?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=was-lisa-marie-elvis-presley-39-s-only-child><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Was Lisa Marie Elvis Presley's Only Child?</span></h2><p>As shown in the movie, and previously mentioned, <a href=#>Elvis and Priscilla had a daughter</a>. Lisa Marie was the light of her parents’ lives; although she became a child of divorce so early in life, she maintained a relationship with both her mom and dad. She went on to live with her mother in the split, but made constant trips to stay with Elvis when the opportunity presented itself.</p><h2 id=elvis-presley-39-s-death-was-somewhat-mysterious><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Elvis Presley's Death Was Somewhat Mysterious</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the end of the biopic, the narrator (his manager) lists a few different reasons as to why Elvis passed away. Some believed it was because of drugs, others say it was exhaustion, but Tom Hanks’ character shared that it was because of his fans/his obsession with fame and adoration. While we have autopsy reports, the details around <a href=#>his death remain somewhat mysterious</a>.</p><h2 id=colonel-tom-parker-fought-for-control-over-elvis-39-life><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Colonel Tom Parker Fought For Control Over Elvis' Life</span></h2><p>One of the most precise portrayals of this movie was the role that Elvis’s manager played in his life. Throughout Presley’s entire career, Colonel Tom Parker took advantage of, manipulated, and ruled over Elvis’s life. From deciding what gigs he played to pushing him to serve in the military to conducting his life on a daily basis—Parker used Elvis however he could to put money into his own pocket.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYq62v9OipWaapam5pr6MnqOvoaNir6q7z6KaZp%2BfqXqztcahq2aZkqTCtXnEpa2iq12lv6a%2Fy56waA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
