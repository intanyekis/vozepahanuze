While Solo’s attack on Riddle provided a plot justification for his absence, the true reason is that Riddle failed a second WWE drug test, forcing the organization to send him to treatment to become clean. There were contradictory rumors about the genuine cause for Riddle’s absence, but the failed second WWE drug test and rehab claim is thought to be true.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-646 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>In an update on Riddle’s current status with WWE, Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter stated that Riddle had been gone for well over 60 days at this time, in February 2023.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>“Riddle has now been gone more than 60 days, which would be the suspension for a second drug test failure. He wasn’t gone 30 days for the first one, but was gone close to 30 days. His injury angle was 12/5 and they said he’d be gone for six weeks, but we’re not coming up on 11 weeks and on 2/3 he’d have been eligible to return.”</p><p>“His name is never mentioned, although when guys are out like that they usually don’t mention them so the return can be a surprise. It does mean the policy has changed because the company didn’t announce the suspension nor did they announce the alleged first one.”</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>When WWE paid Shawn Michaels $750000 to do absolutely nothing</a></p><h2 id=h-when-can-be-matt-riddle-s-return-anticipated><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-869 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>When can be Matt Riddle’s return anticipated?</h2><p>Riddle was slated to be absent for more than 90 days beginning December 5. This implies that he may return before the Show of Shows. There is, however, no formal timetable for Randy Orton’s return. This, however, will provide Orton with much-needed injury rehabilitation time. Furthermore, RK-Bro isn’t really required on WWE RAW right now. The stars can’t get involved in the championship preparations right away since The Bloodline is preoccupied with Kevin Owens, Sami Zayn, and Cody Rhodes.</p><h2>Matt Riddle is been out as he failed his second drug test</h2><p>Cassidy Haynes of Bodyslam.net later reported that Riddle had failed a drug test and would be heading to rehab – the apparent’real’ reason he was kicked from TV. While a person “close to Riddle” rejected the tale, stating that Riddle had been off the air due to the stress of divorce, Sean Ross Sapp of Fightful indicated that he had seen “a lot of stuff” to back up Cassidy Haynes’ initial account. Riddle is reportedly out of rehab, according to Dave Meltzer, fueling anticipation about his WWE return.</p><p><strong>Get the latest from Sportslumo.com by following us on&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Twitter</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=#>YouTube</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2Ftb%2FLrqSoZpOkunDD1p5mp52nqHq4tMSnZLChnKF6rq3TrWSroZSZuaZ50Z6rrqqeYq%2Bir8pmq6hlp6yycA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
