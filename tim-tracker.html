When Tim created his YouTube channel, he was working a full-time job and didn’t want people to be able to locate him.</li><li>Tim is typically the one in front of the camera while Jenn does the majority of video editing.</li><li>His signature outro phrase is “Now it’s time to pay the price”. It refers to liking, sharing, subscribing, or commenting to ‘pay the price’ for watching a video that is often longer than 20 minutes.</li><li>Tim didn’t come up with the outro phrase. He borrowed it from an Adult Swim series titled Home Movies, at the suggestion of one of his friends.</li><li>Tim and Jenn had a Dachshund named Armani who died from an undisclosed illness on December 29, 2016. They also have a Dachshund named Bandit whom they call ‘Bean’ for short. On the profile picture for his YouTube channel, Armani is depicted with a halo above his head.</li><li>He has experienced ‘doxing’ e.g. people leaking personal information such as address.</li><li>He and Jenn bought and moved into a house in December 2018. A major reason for the decision was their former next-door neighbor who trespassed and even stole water from their property.</li><li>Tim and his wife launched the 1st episode of their podcast, TheTimTracker Podcast, in late July 2019.</li><p>Featured Image by Tim Tracker / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jq2gpmWkp66kt8SrZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
