Contact would go a long way in getting this resolved."</p><p>Earlier this month, it was revealed that <a href=#>Nikki is requesting $15,000 per month</a> in child support. In legal fees, she claims this is tantamount to her monthly expenses. She also wants him to cover her legal fees. It’s unclear if she’s also pursuing spousal support.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Moreover, Nikki is also hoping to be awarded full physical and legal custody of their son, with Bam being reduced to supervised visitation.</p><p>Despite having an <a href=#>estimated net worth of $1 million</a>, Nikki claims her estranged husband is worth $55 million in total when considering all his assets, the documents continue.</p><p>Although Bam became a household name thank to the Jackass franchise, he lost the opportunity to star in the latest instalment, 2020’s Jackass Forever, when he was fired allegedly over drug and alcohol dependency issues.</p><p>Bam went on to file a wrongful termination lawsuit against the movie’s production, which was eventually privately settled. Bam checked into rehab shortly after, though the stint was short-lasted. Hopefully, his upcoming stay in treatment has a more successful outcome.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Prince Harry & Meghan Markle’s Son Archie Spoiled By Lavish 4th Birthday Gift</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSvormMppirn5Wnrm6vwKWjrGWVrXq4tcWeZJpll6S5pXnDop6gnaJirqfAxKtkoZ2jYr2trcKem2annmK9tMXCoaCarKKesG60zqWbaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
