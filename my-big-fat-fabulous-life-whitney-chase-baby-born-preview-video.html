That’s why he didn’t say anything. Whitney didn’t know because she muted Chase on Instagram. She pulls out her phone to check Chase’s Instagram.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“Apparently, Chase had his baby and I didn’t know,” Whitney says in her confessional. “In the last day, he has posted lots of pictures and, you know, this heartfelt caption about having his baby, and she’s actually really beautiful. He looks really happy. Apparently, the baby came early, and I know for a fact that Ryan would have known the day that it happened, and I didn’t know. Because the baby wasn’t born yesterday, he just posted about it yesterday.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Ashleigh and Buddy try to comfort Whitney after she finds out about Chase. “I don’t want to talk,” she says as she walks away. Buddy admits he didn’t think Whitney would have cared. Whitney feels “stupid” for being the last to know about this.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Chase’s baby, a girl, was born three months after he and Whitney had split. The couple broke off their engagement in May 2020 after Whitney learned he was expecting a baby with another woman. The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>latest season</a> of My Big Fat Fabulous Life airs Tuesdays at 8 p.m. on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH1ze49xZqaxXZe2qHnFmqtmnpGXwq271KxkpaGWmnq4tMitpZ6xXZi1or%2FEZpmamqlir7C%2BzWanq52mnrK4edWim56nXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
