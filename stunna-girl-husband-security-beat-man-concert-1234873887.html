Instead of reacting immediately, she continued performing before speaking to her husband, who fans identified as RichMula500.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Upon learning what happened, he stepped into the crowd and had a conversation with the man who both he and Stunna Girl believed did the act. Per the footage, the man who slapped her butt was wearing a long sleeve Black shirt with a grey design on the arm; the man who RichMula500 spoke to had the exact same design, so it seems like they got the right guy.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>A male fan decided to slap Stunna Girl’s butt while she was performing in New York and got beat up by her husband, Young Rich Mula and security.<a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/ZlQXLbqiIy</a></p>— No Jumper (@nojumper) <a href=# rel=nofollow>April 28, 2024</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">It is worth noting that RichMula500 did not incite the fight, though he and the man were nose-to-nose while intensely speaking with one another. Stunna Girl’s security got into the mix when they grabbed the man by his neck and took him to the ground before punching him repeatedly. She initially attempted to get involved in the fight but was escorted away, which ended up being the right decision as the brawl escalated to where chairs were being thrown and other concertgoers got involved.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">It is safe to say that the man who inappropriately touched Stunna Girl learned his lesson. She took pride in her husband standing up for her via X (<a href=#>formerly known as Twitter</a>). A fan recounted the situation and how RichMula500 “don’t play about his wife,” and she quoted it and wrote “[Ni**az know].”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">She made another post about the situation, highlighting the Syracuse women acting right at the show. “Anyways I still love the Girllies from Syracuse y’all was sooo turnt up,” she wrote. Do not be surprised if Stunna Girl’s next show in Syracuse is women’s only.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Anyways I still love the Girllies from Syracuse y’all was sooo turnt up ??</p>— STUNNA (@realstunnagirl) <a href=# rel=nofollow>April 27, 2024</a></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Stunna Girl has been rolling musically for the last year. Earlier this month, she joined Vanessa Doll on “187.” She kicked 2024 off with the January release “Stand Up” featuring YG. In 2023, her record “Like Dat” took off and she enlisted the help of <a href=#>French Montana </a>and <a href=#>JT </a>on remixes to the song to continue its momentum.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Stunna Girl hasn’t released a full LP since 2021’s Stunna This Stunna That, her second album overall. She debuted in 2019 with YKWTFGO.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6jBtrrNmmSgoaKheqnB0puYp5xdqLKkwdGiq7JlkpqutXnMmqVmm5%2BjsKa%2B02Zoa2tkbYR0hJdwZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
