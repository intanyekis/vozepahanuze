Chill!”&nbsp;and holds up his hand.</p><p>But the attacker pursues Carson, pulling a knife, as the victim’s girlfriend, running up behind them,&nbsp;is heard frantically yelling, “Please, please, please!”</p><p>As he runs, Carson tumbles over the bench the couple had earlier been sitting on.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The attacker is seen approaching as Carson tries to back away. <span class=credit>Obtained by NY Post</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The suspect allegedly seethed, “What the f–k are you looking at?” before attacking Carson without warning. <span class=credit>Obtained by NY Post</span></figure><p>The assailant then grabs his jacket and knocks him onto the ground, savagely stabbing him multiple times in the chest&nbsp;as the victim’s girlfriend catches up to them.&nbsp;</p><p>He then walks away as Carson lies curled up on the ground, before returning and approaching the terrified woman, who raises her hand to stop him.</p><p>The sicko spits on her&nbsp;— while still clutching the knife —&nbsp;before kicking the mortally wounded Carson and storming away.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The maniac can be seen turning on the mortally wounded victim’s girlfriend, spitting in her face. <span class=credit>Obtained by NY Post</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The savage murder took place after the couple had attended a wedding together. <span class=credit>CLAUDIAPOSTING/Twitter</span></figure><p>An unknown woman&nbsp;then appears near the corner of the frame, yelling, “Don’t hurt him!” at the&nbsp;crazed man&nbsp;and repeating what sounds like the name&nbsp;“Brian” or “Bryan.”</p><p>Investigators believe that the woman and the suspect knew each other prior to the slaying, police sources said Tuesday.</p><p>“I’m so sorry!” the same woman exclaims as she approaches Carson, still lying on the sidewalk, as his worried girlfriend stands at his side.&nbsp;</p><p>“Go watch him,”&nbsp;the victim’s girlfriend directs the woman while pointing at the attacker.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Carson is seen on the ground after the attack. <span class=credit>Obtained by NY Post</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Carson’s girlfriend kneels over him before first responders arrive. <span class=credit>Obtained by NY Post</span></figure><p>“I’m calling 911,” she adds.</p><p>The video cuts off as the girlfriend kneels over her loved one’s body, gently moving his arm that had been hanging over his face.</p><p>She held her gravely injured boyfriend in her arms before he was rushed to Kings County Hospital Center, but it was too late —&nbsp;as a stab wound had pierced his heart, according to cops and sources.</p><p>The horrific attack happened at Lafayette Avenue and Malcolm X Boulevard, just blocks from the Bedford-Nostrand avenues train station, where the couple had gotten off the subway on their way home from the wedding, cops said.&nbsp;</p><p>No arrests had been made in the heinous crime by Tuesday afternoon, but a “Wanted” poster circulated showing a close-up of the suspect wearing a black Champion sweatshirt.&nbsp;</p><p>Investigators have not recovered the murder weapon, which sources said the suspect initially tossed in a pile of trash before quickly going back to retrieve it.</p><p>A pair of glasses — apparently worn by the victim — and two books that Carson’s girlfriend appeared to have been carrying during the violent ordeal were found by investigators at the site of the attack.</p><p>Carson — who came to the Big Apple from the Boston area in 2010 to attend Pratt Institute — was a senior solid waste campaign manager at the New York Public Interest Research Group (NYPIRG), according to his LinkedIn.&nbsp;</p><p>His activism focused on sustainability and environmental policies, friends told The Post.&nbsp;</p><p>In a statement, NYPIRG called Carson “a beloved staffer, colleague and friend, and a creative, talented, relentless and upbeat advocate for students and the environment.”</p><p>“His engaging personality, hearty laugh, and wide-ranging intelligence were keys to his success in advancing the causes he deeply cared about in his work and personal life,” the organization said of their dedicated employee. “Ryan was a consummate team player who would happily undertake the basic ‘blocking and tackling’ tasks necessary to advance and win on an issue, but also shined in the spotlight as a leader, campaign manager, and spokesperson.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Ryan Carson was a selfless advocate and poet who was well-loved by his friends. <span class=credit>Facebook</span></figure><p>A roommate who declined to give his name told The Post that&nbsp;150 people attended a Monday night vigil for Carson in Bedford-Stuyvesant.&nbsp;</p><p>“At the vigil, we asked people, ‘Who here is a better person because of Ryan Carson?’” the roommate said Tuesday.</p><p>“And almost everyone in that crowd raised their hand.”</p><p>When the roommate heard of Carson’s death, he said, his thoughts immediately turned to those who would be impacted by the tragic loss.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="inline-module__title headline headline--combo-sm-md">Keep up with

How do I let people know?” he said he thought.&nbsp;</p><p>But the alleged attacker hadn’t crossed his mind as much, he said.&nbsp;</p><p>“[The suspect] is the least important part of this conversation,” the roomie added. “I have no feelings of vengeance and I don’t think that’s healthy. I’m not angry about that.”</p><p>Another roommate and friend,&nbsp;Tom Krantz, 31, said Monday that it was remarkable “how much [Carson] actually did for the entire city and for his friends.</p><p>“He’s really … like the epicenter of an entire community that he created, that he brought together.</p><p>“I don’t think anyone is exaggerating when they say he would give the shirt off his back,” the roommate added.</p><p>“He was the guy that bent over backward time and time again to be there with his friends.”&nbsp;</p><p>He once walked 500 miles across New York “to raise awareness to pass legislation for the institution of the first overdose prevention facility in the state,” said friend and former classmate Alex Harristhal, 29.</p><p>Carson was also a published poet, who once penned a poem called “Anxiety” about fears over his own death — namely about the “inconvenience” his passing would cause others.&nbsp;</p><p>“That it could come while someone waits for me, that I couldn’t call to let them know I was held up,” he wrote in the poem.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Carson, originally from the Boston area, moved to the Big Apple in 2010 to attend Pratt Institute.</figure><p>Acadia Cutschall, 32 — who attended school with Carson, volunteered with him, and called him her “best friend” — went to his stoop to mourn his death Monday.&nbsp;</p><p>“I was present once when he literally talked a guy out of mugging him,” Cutschall said. “He gave him some money.”&nbsp;</p><p>If Carson had the opportunity, he may have even lent a hand to the man who took his life, according to Cutschall.&nbsp;</p><p>“He would probably help out a guy like that,” she said.</p><p>Additional reporting by Haley Brown and Paul Martinka</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGlmaWtfmba0wNSrmaKml2LDqrDEqGSsoJ%2BswG65zqacp6xdl7Ktu9Wem2aZk6m2t7XSrWSpp5Wpeqq%2FjKuYp5yform6edKtmJualZl6tbuMnZyarJhitq95xaump6xdpLNus8iro5%2BqmZq7pXnOp2SnsZNiwLW%2BxJ6raA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
