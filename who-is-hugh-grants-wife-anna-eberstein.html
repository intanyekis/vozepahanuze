Let's have a look and see.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Look Inside Hugh Grant's Relationship With Elizabeth Hurley</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-anna-eberstein>Who Is Anna Eberstein?</h2>Let's get a few basic facts down: Anna Eberstein was born in Sweden in 1983. Her mom Susanne is a high-powered Swedish politician who knows how to get things done. Anna is totally her mother's daughter.You might say Anna is the studious type. According to factandu.com, &nbsp;she attended Oxford Brookes University in the late 1990s, where she studied English and political science. No, it's not part of the&nbsp; Oxford University. But it has a pretty good rep. Also, she completed her Masters in Economics from Uppsala University in Uppsala, Sweden. And just for fun, she did some work on an MBA in London.In December of 2008 when she was 25-years-old, she joined ESPN &nbsp;as the&nbsp;on-air promotions coordinator,&nbsp;and later was promoted to an assistant producer. Our Anna is a go-getter. By 2011 she had been promoted yet again, becoming the&nbsp;promotions producer for marketing and sales in April 2011.By September of 2013, she was with Hugh Grant and confident enough of her background and experience to leave <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> ESPN&nbsp; to work as a freelance "creative producer and director."And she's quite the entrepreneur. She and her cousin started up "Ace&Me" in London in 2014. Don't laugh, but it's a company that sells Scandinavian slipper-socks to the Brits.And, don't forget, she's a keen tennis player, belonging to the prestigious Queens Club in London. She drags poor old Hugh onto the court whenever she can.<h2 class=body-text>On-Again, Off-Again, On-Again Thing With Hugh Grant</h2>Hugh Grant, the star of iconic films such as&nbsp; Four Weddings and a Funeral&nbsp; and&nbsp; Love Actually,&nbsp; is obsessively closed-mouth about his private life, but he and Anna seem to have first gotten together in early 2012. <span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hugh Grant Admits He Has No Idea What Happened In His Holiday Movie 'Love Actually'</a></span><p class=body-text>By the time the news broke, there were a couple broke in 2014, the couple had broken up. It was kind of weird because both Tinglan Hong and Anna Eberstein live within walking distance of Hugh's house in Fulham in West London. And in 2012, they were both pregnant with Hugh's sons at the same time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=body-text>According to the Daily Mail,&nbsp;after the break-up, Hugh&nbsp;assured the world he and Anna were great friends and that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anna was a wonderful mother</a>. He claimed that he saw his son with Anna almost every day. He probably had to coordinate his schedule so that Tinglan and Anna didn't roll up to his place at the same time!</p><p class=body-text>But Anna and Hugh just couldn't stay away from one another and in December of 2015, their second child was born. And from then on it was happy families. A third little bundle of joy came along in early 2018. And, finally, they were married in May of that same year.</p><h2 id=the-marriage>The Marriage</h2><p>According to&nbsp;nickiswift.com,&nbsp;Grant (in part) married Anna so that the whole family would end up with British passports, making traveling easier.</p><p>That sounds pretty far-fetch, but Swift does quote Grant as saying:</p><p>"My wife agrees with me that marriage is a pretty preposterous social construct. But when you've got three children, it's the nice thing to do."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hugh's marriage to Anna Eberstein works because she is a strong, confident woman who can handle his infamous bouts of bad humor and his tendency to be a bit of a grump. And&nbsp;don't forget Hugh tends to mouth off about his female co-stars. We can just imagine Anna telling him to zip it sometimes.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Was Hugh Grant Too Brutally Honest About His Former Female Co-Stars?</a></span></p><p>As a mother, she is very hands-on.&nbsp;We cannot imagine that Hugh Grant could ever be described as a hands-on father, so much of the day to day parenting is probably left to Anna.</p><p>Hugh's contribution? Well, according to&nbsp;celebritynetworth&nbsp;he is worth $150 million dollars. He's rich and famous and that opens a lot of doors as far as his kids are concerned.</p><p>Who cares if he's grumpy most of the time? Anna just gets on with whatever needs doing.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Hugh Grant Once Spent $3.5 Million On An Andy Warhol Painting</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsButNSgn2afopa7tb%2BMsKCfnV2Wu6%2BtjJ6ZnqqjqbKquo4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
