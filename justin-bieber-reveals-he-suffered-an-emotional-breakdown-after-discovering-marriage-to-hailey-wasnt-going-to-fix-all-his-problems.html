During an interview with&nbsp;GQ&nbsp;last April, the&nbsp;Stay&nbsp;singer noted how relationships aren’t always easy, as he was dealing with a lot of “trauma” during the start of his marriage.</p><p>“The first year of marriage was really tough,” he explained. “Because there was a lot, going back to the trauma stuff. There was just [a] lack of trust. There was all these things that you don’t want to admit to the person that you’re with, because it’s scary. You don’t want to scare them off by saying: ‘I’m scared.’”</p><p>However, Bieber said that their relationship changed once he started believing more in his marriage, as he has continued “creating” memories with his wife.</p><p>“We’re just creating these moments for us as a couple, as a family, that we’re building these memories,” he added. “And it’s beautiful that we have that to look forward to.”</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmihrquknrtursiemZ6qXaeyt7HApapmoJViwLayxZ6pnpxdlrtuscyoq6Knnpa5bq7RnpiknJ%2Bsu26txa2cq2WUnsCku9WeqaKml2K6or7RopignV2pvG60wKKjnrFdrK60utNmnqihnpx6tbuMn6CxZZGhuW60yKxkqaqfl7mmudJo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
