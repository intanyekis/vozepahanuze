He has a tiger on one arm. He has a cross in the center of his chest covering his heart. He has angel wings mixed with the words “Son of God”, ‘Forgive,” and “Purpose” plus the roman numerals, I IX VII V, which in English is 1-9-7-5. 1975 was the birth year of Justin’s mom, <a href=#>Pattie Mallette</a>, whom he adores.</p><p>Justin also has a tattoo of a Native American chief on his back, praying hands on the back of one leg, Jesus on the front of one leg, and an owl on one arm. On the right shoulder of his back, he has a quote from the Bible, Psalm 199:105 “Your word is the lamp for my feet, a light on my path.”</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>JUSTIN BIEBER SPOTTED WITH A NEW WOMAN</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> reports that over one hundred hours of tattoo work has been done on Justin’s body. Bieber hired the New York-based tattoo artist, Keith “Bang Bang” McCurdy to complete his chest tattoos. This took three long sessions, which totaled 26 hours spread over three consecutive days. Ouch! That is a lot of concentrated needle-pricking. McCurdy says Bieber is “tough as nails.”</p><p>Bieber’s fascination with tattoos began when he was around 14 years old. In total, Justin now has over 60 tattoos on his body. Many can be seen in his Instagram selfie photos; however, a few he keeps private. He says he has no regrets about his body art and that getting the tattoos was so much fun.</p><p>Most of his tattoos are based on religious symbolism. A few are from his personal relationships. A long time ago, when he was first dating <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a>, he got a tattoo of her on one wrist. After they broke up, he had it shaded in a bit to disguise it; however, everyone knows it is still there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There was hope that Bieber and Gomez would get back together again after Gomez broke up with The Weeknd. The two spent some happy times together; however, <a href=#>Selena’s mom</a> is totally against their rekindled relationship. The couple recently decided to take a break; however, Bieber insists he wants to be with Gomez again. Perhaps,&nbsp;Bieber can use artistic skin-bleaching or laser surgery to un-shade the Selena Gomez tattoo on his wrist in order to show his continued dedication to her.</p><p>No matter what one thinks about body art, we have to admit Justin’s collection seems to work together in a harmonious way. It looks better now that it is more complete, reminding us a bit of the artwork found in the Sistine Chapel.</p><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>SELENA GOMEZ'S SHIRT TAKES SHOTS AT JUSTIN BIEBER</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nmqrAtbXNZpminZKav27AwK2rqKddnby2vtJo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
