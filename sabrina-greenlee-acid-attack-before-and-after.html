She is a survivor of domestic violence.</p><p>Her constant commitment to the advancement and development of women is evidence of her fortitude, adaptability, and empathy.</p><p>In addition, DeAndre Hopkins, an American professional football wide receiver for the Arizona Cardinals of the National Football League, was born to Greenlee.</p><h2>What happened to Sabrina Greenlee before the acid attack?</h2><p>Sabrina Greenlee, the mother of DeAndre Hopkins, bravely spoke up and revealed the horrific specifics of a life-altering attack, shedding light on the fortitude and strength required to get through such a devastating ordeal.</p><p>Greenlee lost her eyes in 2002 as a result of a terrible acid attack. Greenlee’s life was irrevocably altered when a lady flung a concoction of lye and bleach on her after she had been betrayed by her lover, who had been having an affair.</p><p>Sabrina Greenlee was left for dead at a gas station with little chance of life because the attack was so terrible. Despite being attacked and spending 10 days in the hospital, she remained steadfast. For the sake of her children, she persisted despite being in a coma and on the verge of death.</p><h2>Update on Sabrina Greenlee following the acid attack on DeAndre Hopkins’ mother</h2><p>As everyone is aware, Sabrina Greenlee went blind more than ten years ago. When Sabrina awoke one morning in July of 2002, her automobile was gone from the driveway. She went to her boyfriend’s former residence to look into her suspicion that he had stolen it.</p><p>When Sabrina Greenlee arrived, Savannah Grant assaulted her and doused her face in a combination of lye and bleach. Sabrina Greenlee subsequently learned Savannah had been dating the same man, even though she didn’t know Savannah at the time.</p><p>In addition, DeAndre, Sabrina’s son, has spoken to the media regarding his mother’s health. The sixth installment of HBO’s Hard Knocks In Season: The Arizona Cardinals presented Greenlee’s tale.</p><p>Sabrina Greenlee is currently living a happy life, and we may follow her there by following her verified account, @sabrinagreenlee12. She is also a founding member of SMOOTH, a nonprofit group that provides outreach, therapy, and education to families affected by domestic violence.</p><p>Sabrina Greenlee was assaulted with acid by Savannah Grant. After the tragic occurrence, Grant received a 20-year jail term.</p><p>For throwing acid at DeAndre’s mother, Grant was also charged with assault and battery with the intent to murder. Given that she was given a 20-year prison term, she appears to have been released.</p><p>Savannah was also a featured guest on Tashak Live, where she spoke candidly about the tragedy that occurred two decades ago. In the interview, Grant detailed what transpired between her, Sabrina, and their lover.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Aeko Catori Brown, Jordana Lajoie, and Cogeian Sky Embry."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":28}{"1":30,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":44}{"1":50,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":67}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/aeko-catori-brown/"}{"1":28}{"1":30,"2":"https://popularbio.com/jordana-lajoie/"}{"1":44}{"1":50,"2":"https://popularbio.com/cogeian-sky-embry/"}{"1":67}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Aeko Catori Brown</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Jordana Lajoie</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Cogeian Sky Embry</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>activist</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Author</a> <a href=# rel=tag>philanthropist</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Brough Scott Wife | Meet Susan E.
