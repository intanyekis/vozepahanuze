The morning show host went missing on Thursday, February 24th.&nbsp;</p><p>Bay Area radio host and DJ JV was reported missing out of San Francisco. <a href=#>Jeffrey Vandergrift</a>, known to listeners of Wild 94.9 as JV, was last seen around 10 PM Thursday, near his San Francisco residence at King street.&nbsp;</p><p>Vandergrift, 54, is considered at-risk, authorities said. Law enforcement agencies have not disclosed the reason behind him being considered at-risk.&nbsp;</p><p>He is 6 feet tall, 180 pounds, with a bald head and brown eyes. He has several tattoos on his arms and above his right ear, and he was last seen wearing black sweatpants.&nbsp;</p><p>Wild 94.9, where Vandergrift hosts ‘The JV Show’ in the mornings, posted a statement to social media.</p><p><strong>“We are deeply concerned, as we know you are, that our own JV has been reported missing by the SFPD. We’re working closely with them and his wife, Natasha, who is also a dear friend and member of the WiLD 94.9 family. We are sending love, thoughts, and prayers to JV and will share more information as we receive it,”</strong> the statement read.</p><p>The wife of Wild 94.9 show host Natasha Yi, also a host, released a statement for the first time since her husband went missing.</p><p>The statement included a show of thankfulness to their friends, the entire i-HeartRadio family, and listeners for their love, support, and prayers.&nbsp;</p><p>She was grateful upon receiving so much love and support for her husband, JV. The amount of compassion for the physical torture JV has been going through for the past two years has overwhelmed her and her family.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the San Francisco Police Department, JV remains missing, but no foul play is suspected in his disappearance.</p><p>No activity has been tracked on his cellphone or credit cards, Wild 94.9 wrote Monday in an Instagram post. “These updates are obviously incredibly worrisome, though we continue to hope and pray for better <a href=#>news</a>,” the post continued.&nbsp;</p><p>Before his disappearance, the 54-year-old Vandergrift publicly shared that he had been coping with Lyme disease. He was diagnosed in 2021. He said brain fog, dizziness, migraines, and blurry vision were symptoms that he said have afflicted him.&nbsp;</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC21WakoqujnruoedSpm5qslWLBqbGMpqarppmjtG6%2Fx6iuZqCfqMFutdJmpaivmJq%2FpnnTqGSbnV2bvLa6w2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
